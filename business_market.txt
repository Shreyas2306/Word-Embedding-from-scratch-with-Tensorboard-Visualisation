As the bull market celebrates its 10th anniversary in March, marking the economy’s longest expansion in decades, one generation of American investors may be particularly vulnerable.   investors, members of America's largest age group who are born between 1981 and 1996, have little experience as adults of a bear market or economic recession. As a result, they are at greater risk of panicking and aggravating a downturn, according to several economists and market analysts, as outlined by  . "It very likely is going to heighten odds of some sort of a panic," said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff and Associates, who is renowned on Wall Street for predicting the housing bubble that ignited the Great Recession. Unlike past generations of new investors, Rosenberg and others say that the unusually benign qualities of the last decade, such as long-lasting growth, historically low interest rates, and accommodative central banks, have left millennial traders unprepared for sustained upheaval or a bear market. Millennials who joined the financial industry or began investing over the past ten years might be unaware of how unusual the recent conditions have been. He and others are concerned that this means painful mistakes, or missed indicators, are more probable now than ever when the current bull market or economic expansion eventually sees its day. "They've only lived through half a cycle over a decade, and you can't help but build up a certain level of hubris,” said Rosenberg, who cited his own career start at Bank of Nova Scotia on Black Monday, October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index tanked 23%. Analysts Bank of America Merrill Lynch echoed that sentiment, pointing out that millennials will be especially ill-equipped to deal with looming market volatility, per  . Based on the slope of the yield curve, BofA strategists predict that volatility could double in 2019. The firm pointed out that the largest cohort of financial services employees — now 25 to 34 years old — has never dealt with that whiplash. "The most memorable early event of their careers was likely the Financial Crisis," BofA equity and quant strategist Savita Subramanian said in the note. "Growth and momentum stocks have outperformed for their entire careers, whereas value investing has been a losing proposition." Dr. Lacy Hunt of Hoisington Investment Management, with over five decades of experience on the Street, is worried that millennials will miss the big picture, thanks to the dominant styles of trading and analysis which have been popularized over the recent decade. “They're going with momentum," he said. "The algorithmic trading enhances all that, too. You get swept up in that mindset." Other strategies such as “buying on the dip,” could hurt millennials who aren’t factoring in the possibility of a long-term decline. It’s important to note that millennials are also a gutsy bunch. The cohort bought up a ton of big techs in 2019, such as Facebook Inc. ( ) and Apple Inc. ( ), when other investors abandoned them, as outlined in an earlier   story. Now, many of the recent laggards are again leading the market in 2019. The younger generation of traders are more apt to buy shares of companies in growth industries, and riskier bets with potential for outsized returns, or major losses. For instance, three cannabis stocks, Cronos Group Inc. ( ), Canopy Growth Corp., ( ) and Aurora Cannabis Inc. ( ), were the most popular among users on popular millennial trading app   this year.Mutual Funds. It's official. This Saturday, March 9, 2019, marks the 10-year anniversary of what many call the longest bull market in history. It all started from the post-crisis low of March 9, 2009. The S&P 500's (SPX) closing price on that fateful day in early 2009 was precisely 676.53. As of the market close on Friday (3/8/2019), the S&P 500 settled at 2743.07. That represents around a 305% rise in a 10-year period. Not bad for a large-cap stock index. The chart above displays some of the most salient market, economic, and political events that have helped to move the S&P 500 in one direction or another during this remarkable decade-long run. Some of the biggest and scariest drops have been attributed simply to surging investor fear. This includes the 2011 anxieties over the spread of the European sovereign debt crisis. It also includes the most recent market plummet in the fourth quarter of 2018. Much of this massive drop was caused by fears of a global economic slowdown, a U.S.-China trade war, and rising U.S. interest rates. Other market drops were triggered by freakish circumstances, including the 2010 'flash crash' and the 'Volmageddon' volatility eruption in early 2018. Also of note on this chart, the UK's Brexit referendum in mid-2016 (in which a majority of the UK public voted to leave the EU) registered only as a relatively limited and short-lived blip in the U.S. markets. Finally, when the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in earnest around the end of 2016 into 2017, the stock market took it in stride and continued to rise sharply. The big question now, of course, is whether this 10-year rally will continue. While we've seen many bumps, both major and minor, on the road to where we are now, the stock market has managed to recover (at least eventually) each and every time. There will always be serious risk factors and fears that pervade markets. Late last year was a rather severe example of this. But we don't believe this bull market, though it's been exceptionally long, has run its course just yet. 
may have topped out following   off deep December 2018 lows. However, new lows aren't likely in the coming months because broad-based sector instruments have drawn   reversals that are likely to presage many months of sideways action. As a result, investors looking for long-side exposure should limit efforts to sector leadership that, according to a recent Forbes survey, includes Poland and Hungary as top plays. Emerging markets can be traded as a group through a variety of   (ETFs). The three most popular instruments by total assets are Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF ( ) at $61.1 million, the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ( ) at $57.4 million and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ( ) at $33.7 million. The price charts are nearly identical, while EEM has the longest price history, coming public in April 2003. The fund entered an immediate uptrend in 2003, carving a broad   into the October 2007 all-time high at $55.83. It carved a small double top pattern into August 2008 and broke down, accelerating lower into November's four-year low in the upper teens. That marked the lowest low in the past 10 years, ahead of a healthy recovery wave that stalled near $50 in 2011, at the same time that   and Chinese growth were topping out.  A pullback into October 2011 found   at $33.42, completing a trading range that held intact into a 2015 breakdown that reached a seven-year low in the mid-$20s in the first quarter of 2016. Bulls took firm control at that level, posting healthy gains that continued into a test of the 2011 high in February 2015. Aggressive sellers emerged when the fund broke  , triggering a  , ahead of a persistent decline that reached a 19-month low in October. It tested that level successfully in December and turned higher through January 2019. The .786   of last decade's bear market has ended two rally attempts, while price action has settled back in the trading range in place between 2011 and 2015. The 50-month   (EMA) has eased into a horizontal orientation at the same level it held during that period, signifying a neutral technical outlook. Meanwhile, the monthly   flipped into a buy cycle in July 2018, presaging a more balanced tape. The decline into October 2018 ended near the .618 Fibonacci retracement of the 2017 into 2018 uptrend, while the December test completed a double bottom reversal, predicting that support in the mid-$30s will hold for now. The bounce through January 2019 reversed at the .382 retracement of the 10-month decline, which has narrowly aligned with the .382 rally retracement, 200-day EMA and the top of the double bottom pattern. The recent reversal at quadruple resistance may signal the start of a testing or base-building process that could last a few months and generate little or no upside. It's even possible that the short-term downturn will accelerate, dropping the fund into a dreaded   test. At a minimum, this complex price structure warns newly minted shareholders to tighten stops and consider taking profits. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator topped out with price in January 2018 and held up until a June breakdown that signaled aggressive distribution. It posted a lower low in December when price posted a higher low, generating a bearish   until the indicator mounted September and November highs. However, it has now dropped back under those levels (red line) in another red flag for an intermediate top. The oversold bounce in emerging markets may have come to an end, setting the stage for sideways action that could persist for many months.

As I have discussed several times in the Chart Advisor,   represents an existential threat to the U.K. and European economies. A serious contraction in those economies would have a profound impact on the U.S. and Asian markets as well. Although there are many risks associated with Brexit that should worry U.S. investors, I believe the two most pressing risks are: However, as dire as all this sounds, the risks of Brexit may be receding slightly. The U.K. Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal (again) and voted today to reject a " " by leaving the EU on March 29 without an agreement. As you can see in the following chart, the GBP/USD exchange rate strengthened in favor of the GBP after the vote; it has climbed back through the neckline of an   pattern. The pressure on the U.S. dollar will likely be lifted some as U.K. and European stocks follow the GBP higher. There is a possibility that investors are making a big bet based on too much optimism. The original Brexit vote on June 16, 2016, was also supposed to have failed. Since I can't predict the future, I will keep my analysis conditional on new information, but at this point, it seems likely that some of the risk that has been stunting market returns in 2018-2019 may be declining. The S&P 500 rallied today at the beginning of the session before losing some ground just before the Brexit vote. As you can see in the following chart, although prices have been rising this week, today's rally paused in the 2,800 range again. As I discussed in the Chart Advisor yesterday, a break to new highs will likely take better performance in small caps and stronger economic data. Although most risk indicators have provided some confirmation (or at least avoided disconfirmation) of the rally this week, government bonds remain stubbornly high. For example, as you can see in the following chart, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( ) gave up very little ground today and only gained yesterday. A positive correlation between long-term   and stocks is usually a bad sign for stocks. If investors are willing to take on more risk, the price of bonds usually falls as investors seek higher yields. My analysis shows that, on days when both TLT and the S&P 500 are up more than +0.30% in a single day, the net return over the next three trading sessions has been net-negative 65% of the time. I don't think I can fully explain the reasons why this short-term signal plays out like it does. I suspect that it is because   or institutional participation is low on the day both assets classes move higher. Although today's performance in stocks didn't play out typically, volatility was still very high, which is the least I would have expected after the strong correlation yesterday. Because Brexit news dominated the trading session, some investors may have missed the fact that   were released today. This announcement is important because it signals demand from consumers and businesses for equipment and products with a useful life of three years or longer. Fortunately, the report showed that orders were up on an adjusted basis, but the gains were relatively moderate.

The   (DJUA) is testing November 2017's all-time high at 779 and could break out in the coming months, entering a strong uptrend. That rally would surprise skeptical market watchers who expect this sleepy sector to underperform due to the market's growing risk appetite. It would also tell sidelined investors to take a closer look at   plays as we exit the second decade of the 21st century. The rally is unfolding despite a bankruptcy filing by DJUA component Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation ( ) in response to potential liabilities incurred during destructive California wildfires. That stock's   has plunged with price in recent months, suggesting that the index would be trading much higher if PG&E weren't one of just 15 components. This also suggests that other components are picking up the slack, exhibiting   that may continue for months or years. NextEra Energy, Inc. ( ), Duke Energy Corporation ( ) and The Southern Company ( ) top the utility sector's performance list, but NextEra is the only member of the trio now trading at an all-time high. NextEra currently pays a 2.66%  , compared with Duke's 4.14% and Southern's 4.75%. At first glance, Duke Energy stock shows the greatest potential upside after it spent the past four years sitting on top of the 2001 high in the mid-$80s. The average topped out near 225 in 1987 and spent the next decade testing  , finally breaking out in 1997 and entering a healthy uptrend that ended above 400 in the fourth quarter of 2000. That marked the highest high for the next five years, ahead of a steep downturn that found   in the 160s in October 2002. The subsequent bounce completed a V-shaped pattern and breakout in 2006, reaching a new high at 556 in January 2008. The average plunged during the economic collapse, finding support in March 2009 at the .618   of the five-year uptrend, and turned higher into the new decade. Limited buying interest kept the average below the 2008 peak until a 2014 breakout that exhibited little upside, basing on top of new support for nearly two years. The subsequent uptick posted two higher highs into November 2017 and eased into a sideways pattern that remains in force nearly 16 months later. The monthly   crossed into a sell cycle in September 2018 and turned higher in February well above the   level, exhibiting unusual strength. It has lifted back into the   zone but is showing no signs of rolling over, predicting that sector strength may continue into the third quarter. Meanwhile, price action has been contained within a rising channel since 2014, predicting that a breakout will reach channel resistance now rising from 840. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator lifted above resistance at the December 2017 high in January 2019 and is now trading at an all-time high, reflecting bullishness that favors higher prices. However, straight up price action since December is generating short-term overbought technical readings that favor a shakeout of   before additional upside. In addition, the rally has now completed a 100% retracement into the 2017 high, marking a resistance level that may trigger a reversal, allowing the utility average to build a more durable breakout pattern. In turn, downside may target the 50- and 200-day   (EMAs), currently rising between 725 and 740. This vulnerability suggests that sidelined investors should wait for lower prices to build positions in index components or funds, rather than chasing the upside. The Dow Jones Utility Average has reached resistance at the 2017 high and could break out in the coming months, but short-term technicals now favor a pullback.

Buzz & Trending  Investing  Markets & Economy  Investing  Markets & Economy International / Global.Chinese stocks have jumped off the blocks in the first two months of 2019 as investors grow more confident that there is a meaningful and long-lasting resolution in sight for the nearly year-long   between the United States and China. Investors have also cheered the Chinese government's unwavering focus on economic growth. With China's   SSE Composite Index ( ) up 22.71% year to date (YTD) as of early March 2019, traders need to be mindful that, even if the world's two largest economies reach a trade agreement in the coming months, share prices for Chinese stocks may have already factored it in. As well as a " " scenario playing out, fears started to emerge late last week that regulators may be concerned with the speed at which Chinese equities are rising. Several analysts believe that a sell rating issued by state-owned   firm Citic Securities on leading insurance firm The People's Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited ( ) was government intervention to temper investor enthusiasm. "Such a sell rating must have been authorized by the regulators," Yang Wei, a fund manager at Longwin Investment Management Co.,  . "The stock market is overheating; there is too much speculation. Regulators want to see a slow bull market, not a mad bull market." Traders who want to bet against Chinese stocks traded on the   should explore these three trading ideas using inverse China   (ETFs). Formed in 2009, the Direxion Daily FTSE China Bear 3X ETF ( ) aims to provide three times the inverse daily performance of the FTSE China 50 Index. The underlying index tracks the 50 largest Chinese stocks traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange but excludes exposure to   – companies that trade on mainland China exchanges. YANG's leverage makes it a suitable instrument for traders who want an aggressive bet against Chinese equities, particularly the financial sector, to which the benchmark allocates a 46.05% weighting. The ETF, with net assets of $80.87 million and an   of 1.02%, has slipped nearly 26% YTD as of March 12, 2019. It pays a 0.80%  . Ironically, the bears have had full control of this China bear ETF for the first two months of 2019. In early March, the fund's price has staged a bounce from crucial technical   at the $42.50 level – where a horizontal line connects several   over the past 12 months. The move higher saw the price break above a steep two-month downtrend line on the most significant volume this year. Traders should look for an entry point close to $45 and book profits on a run up to $55  . Cut losing trades if the price closes beneath last month's low at $42.03. The ProShares UltraShort FTSE China 50 ( ), created in 2007, seeks to offer two times the inverse daily return of the FTSE China 50 Index – the same benchmark YANG tracks. FXP's tight 0.05%   and an average volume of nearly 90,000 shares per day make this fund ideal for those wanting to have a moderate play against Chinese equities. FXP isn't exactly cheap with its 0.95% management fee, although that shouldn't overly affect short-term stays. As of March 12, 2019, FXP has   (AUM) of $33.55 million and yields 0.20%. It is down 17.81% YTD. Because FXP tracks the same index as YANG, the two charts look similar. The fund's price traded roughly within a 20-point range between July and December last year before falling away in January and February as Chinese stocks rallied on hopes of a trade deal breakthrough between Washington and Beijing. Monday's pullback allows swing traders to take a position near the $60 level and aim for a move back up toward the 200-day   (SMA) at $70. Place a   just beneath crucial support at $56.50. Consider moving stop orders to the   at the $66 level – an area where the price may encounter resistance from the 50-day SMA and the bottom trendline of last year's six-month trading range. With net assets of $6.58 million and yielding 0.28%, the ProShares Short FTSE China 50 ETF ( ) seeks to provide the inverse daily return of the FTSE China 50 Index. YXI, the less leveraged version of FXP, suits traders who want basic inverse exposure to Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong or investors who require a short-term   against a long-only portfolio of China  . With only 10,950 shares changing hands per day, traders should use limit orders to avoid paying excessive  . The ETF's 0.95% expense ratio is in line with products that use derivative instruments to achieve inverse returns. As of March 12, 2019, YXI has a YTD return of -8.84%. YXI's share price formed a loosely constructed   over the second half of 2018. Like the other China bear ETFs, the fund trended sharply lower over the first eight weeks of this year before catching a   in early March to break out above a trendline extending back to early January. Above-average volume accompanied the move higher, indicating conviction from the bulls. China bears who want to dig their claws into this ETF should enter on the current retracement and position a   in the vicinity of the head and shoulder pattern's   at the $19.80 level. Traders should close positions quickly if price breaches the 2019 low at $18.13.Stocks.Bruni's presentation at   focused on   and how we like to keep our process of looking at the subject pretty simple. While that presentation covered a number of our methods of measuring the market's internals, in this post, we want to share some stats we pulled this weekend that help provide some valuable context around the market's rally from the Dec. 24 lows. The table below outlines the major U.S. Indexes we cover with performance stats from important inflection points: the January 2018 highs, the September 2018 peak and the Dec. 24 low. We also have some additional stats listed like percentage below 52-week high and above 52-week low, days since those events occurred, whether the daily   (RSI) reading is in a bullish or bearish range, and whether prices are above their 200-day  . The columns we want to pay attention to for now are the first three. The rally from the December lows has been fierce, with all 27 indexes positive at a median return of 17.79%. By looking at those stats from only one time frame, one might conclude that we're out of the woods and that stocks are back in rally mode ... however, backing up to the January or September 2018 highs tells a much different story. Only 2 of 27 indexes are above their January 2018 highs, with a median return of -4.56%. Bull markets in stocks begin when they exceed their prior peak, so until we do that, these stats would argue for a more of a "hot mess" of a   than anything else. Another important takeaway from this table is in the performance numbers. By looking at the outer tails of performers, we can spot the trends we want to be participating in on the long and short side. Among the best performers across both time frames are the   and the technology sector, while the   lags considerably. If you want to be in the areas of the market showing the most relative strength and weakness, this simple exercise gives you a great high-level view of the playing field that you can then drill down into further to identify the plays you want on your team. 
Investing.I am regularly asked why I almost exclusively use the S&P 500 as a "proxy" for the stock market, instead of the   (aka "the Dow"). The S&P 500 is the standard among professionals (and many retail traders), but the Dow is better known among novice investors. There is no perfect average that will reflect the overall market impartially. However, most standard approaches use some weighted average based on market capitalization. That way, the largest and most valuable companies have a greater effect on the index than the smallest companies. A   works fine because the most successful companies tend to have the greatest value. One of the most important drawbacks is that a weighted index can be distorted when one of the largest companies, like Apple Inc. ( ), has a particularly good or bad day, which has a disproportionate effect on the index. Unlike the S&P 500, the Dow index uses a weighting methodology that makes no sense. The 30 stocks included in the index are weighted based on share price, which has nothing to do with market value or growth. That means that, if the highest-priced stock in the index, The Boeing Company ( ), is having a bad day, it will overwhelm the performance of Pfizer, Inc. ( ) which has a nearly identical market capitalization as Boeing but a share price of $41.25 vs Boeing's at $395.84. This was exactly the problem this morning when the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes opened higher while the Dow was negative. As you have probably seen in the news, two of Boeing's 737 planes have been involved in recent crashes, which resulted in a decline of up to 8% at one point in today's session. Traders are worried about the company's liability, brand and goodwill after these tragedies. For most fundamental investors, the problems with the Dow's methodology aren't an issue; for technical traders or investors who use index analysis to measure risk and make portfolio decisions, the choice of index is much more important. Speaking of indexes, the S&P 500 shot straight up today as investor confidence returned. The early rebound seems to have been aided by a higher-than-expected   report. I was frankly a little underwhelmed with the retail data after last month's debacle. I suspect that an adjustment or revision is still coming and should show up next month. Also contributing to the rally was an announced deal that NVIDIA Corporation ( ) will acquire Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. ( ) for $7 billion. As I have mentioned in previous issues of the Chart Advisor, academic research shows that large acquisitions and mergers rarely create a positive return. However, they are helpful ways to think about risk- appetite. Acquisitions of this size are risky, and managers and boards tend to only undertake them only when confidence for growth in the near future is high. From a technical perspective, I am still wary of the 2,800   on the S&P 500, but last week's   could act like the pause at the end of January that was just long enough for investors to refocus on undervalued opportunities and push the market higher. If there is more confirming evidence in the bond market and if the value of the U.S. dollar can ease back off its highs, then the probability of breaking resistance will be higher. Despite the selling last week, there weren't any overt signs of panic, which made today's rally a lot more likely. Except for an overly bullish U.S. dollar (USD), most risk indicators are still low. Even if stocks give up today's gains later this week, if panic stays out of the market, then I will maintain my bullish bias. One of the indicators that could provide early warning that investors are preparing to push stocks higher and use more leverage is the Japanese yen (JPY). As you can see in the following chart of the USD-JPY  , the currency has been rejected at its 61.8%   of the recent downtrend. That means the yen got stronger last week while stocks dropped, which is normal. If the exchange rate rises back through this resistance level (indicating that the yen is getting weaker), then we should expect stocks to rise as well. The correlation between the yen and stocks isn't perfect, but it frequently leads market rallies. For example, it led the stock rally last April by a little more than two weeks. If it happens, I wouldn't expect a breakout like that to occur any earlier than this Friday. The second week of the month is usually a little quiet for economic announcements. However, besides today's retail report, the   data that will be released on Wednesday morning before the market opens could provide helpful confirmation. Durable goods are those industrial and retail products with an expected life-span of three years or more. A positive durable goods report could offset investor worries about the tariffs – at least temporarily – and help push stocks through resistance.As the weather continues to warm across North America, it is natural for investors to start thinking again about investments in agriculture. Given fundamental factors such as ample supply mixed with relatively low demand, agricultural   have experienced a significant amount of selling pressure over the past several weeks. In this article, we'll take a look at the three   that are widely used to track segments of the agriculture sector to determine how traders will want to position themselves over the weeks or months ahead. For many active traders who follow the agriculture sector, there are few more popular funds to watch than the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund ( ). Fundamentally, the DBA fund comprises   on some of the most liquid and widely traded agricultural commodities such as live cattle, soybeans, sugar, corn, wheat, coffee and cotton. Taking a look at the chart below, you can see that the bears recently pushed the price of the fund below the trendline of a defined   pattern. The breakdown is a clear indicator to active traders that the next leg of the downtrend has begun and that the momentum is now in the favor of the bears. Based on the pattern, followers of technical analysis will likely set their target prices near $15.75, which is equal to the entry point minus the height of the pattern. One of the most interesting chart patterns found anywhere in the public markets can be seen on the chart of the Teucrium Soybean Fund ( ). As you can see below, the price of the fund recently tested the   of its 200-day   and failed to break above it. In fact, the resistance was strong enough to turn away multiple attempts to move higher and has led to a break below a key level of short-term  . The move below the dotted trendline on the chart shows that the bears are in clear control of the momentum and that the price could be headed toward the 2018 low of $15.26. That last chart we will look at today that will be of specific interest to commodity traders belongs to the Teucrium Wheat Fund ( ). As you can see below, the bears were able to send the price below a key trendline, and the selling pressure has yet to cease. With extremely   readings on indicators such as the   (RSI), it wouldn't be surprising to see a bounce toward the newly formed resistance near $5.85. Bearish traders will likely keep a close eye on the chart in hopes to enter a position at a level that offers a much more lucrative risk/reward. Agriculture commodities are coming back into focus after a long and cold winter. Based on the charts discussed above, it seems as though the bears are currently in control of the momentum, and recent price action suggests that traders will hold a downward bias for the next several months.

The   (BLS) had been delivering bullish news for the past 16 months, and most analysts and traders believed that it was going to do so again Friday. Unfortunately for those optimistic traders who were looking for more bullish economic news, the BLS delivered a sucker punch to the gut instead. The BLS reported that the U.S. economy created a measly 20,000 new jobs during February. I say measly because the consensus estimate was looking for 180,000 new jobs to be created, and most analysts look at the 200,000 new jobs level as the threshold between strong jobs growth and weak jobs growth. As you can imagine, traders weren't happy at all when this news was released before the opening bell. Traders sent stocks lower in pre-market trading, and the major indexes all   lower. Here's the interesting thing, though – none of the major indexes have continued falling. After their initial knee-jerk response to start selling stocks after receiving bad economic news, traders quickly started buying again and stabilized the market. They reminded themselves that reacting to a single economic announcement is counterproductive. Big economic beats or misses make for great headlines, but they make for lousy long-term trading guides because they can be so volatile. All you have to do is look back on the   numbers the BLS has reported over the past few years to see just how quickly one month's numbers can tank, only to be followed by extremely strong numbers the next month. In May 2016, the U.S. economy created ~15,000 new jobs. This could have been a worrisome number, except for the fact that the economy created ~282,000 new jobs the next month. We saw the same thing in September and October 2017. The economy created ~18,000 new jobs in September and then went on to create ~260,000 new jobs in October. Knowing that this pattern exists, we have to wonder how many jobs the economy might create in March after creating only 20,000 in February. It's possible that we might see another 200,000+ jobs number next month. If that is the case, we don't need to worry about the low number this month. Of course, just because a pattern exists in the past doesn't guarantee that it is going to carry on into the future. If the jobs numbers for March look as bleak as they did for February, we have to start wondering if a new trend is being established, rather than a volatile blip among otherwise healthy numbers. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. For now, today's jobs miss by itself is nothing to hang your bearish hat on. It was a bearish week for the S&P 500, but it could have been worse. The index completed a   on Thursday when it dropped down through the slightly uptrending support level it had been interacting with. Based on the height of the consolidation range that formed the body of the reversal pattern, the double top gives us a downside price target of ~2,700. However, by holding its ground today after the initial shock of the disappointing nonfarm payrolls number, the S&P 500 was able to stay above this bearish price target and maintain the multi-month uptrend it has been in by establishing another higher low. The low that was established today as the index recovered will need to be confirmed by another bullish day on Monday, but today's   looks promising. If we broaden our scope just a little, the S&P 500 is still firmly consolidating between longer-term support at 2,630 and longer-term resistance at 2,800. This tells us that, while we may have seen a little profit taking this week, we're not experiencing any type of panic selling that we need to be concerned about heading into the weekend. The S&P 500 wasn't the only indicator moving lower this week. The   (TNX) also pulled back from the short-term high it had established to close at 2.63% – its lowest level since plunging to close at 2.55% on Jan. 3. Depending on how you draw your support level, you could make the argument that the TNX has now completed a bearish triangle   and is destined to continue dropping lower (as you can see in the chart below), but I think it is premature to make that call. Today's bearish candlestick – a   – is far from convincing as a sign of extreme bearishness. Spinning-top dojis typically appear during moments of market uncertainty. I wouldn't be surprised to see the TNX continue to consolidate within the same 0.2% range it has been in for most of 2019. While I wouldn't be surprised to see the TNX hold at support next week, if it does continue to break lower, watch out for more bearishness in the stock market as well. These two indicators tend to move in the same direction, and while we did see a   in their performance a few weeks ago, that divergence seems to have played itself out, and the positive correlation has returned.

The   (FOMC) continued to tighten monetary policy last week with the unwinding of its balance sheet. The   was marked at $3.969 trillion on March 6, down $5 billion from $3.974 trillion on Feb. 27, which is a modest Fed tightening move. The balance sheet is down $531 billion from its level of $4.5 trillion at the end of September 2017. In my opinion, the Fed wants to continue to unwind the balance sheet until later this year. I believe that that the Fed is aggressive now given stable stock market conditions. The normalization of Federal Reserve policy includes the unwinding of its bloated balance sheet. The Federal Reserve balance sheet was expanded by policies called   (QE). Under QE, the Federal Reserve bought   and  . These buying programs took place between December 2008 and October 2014. The Fed purchased $3.7 trillion in securities, which expanded the balance sheet to $4.5 trillion. The purpose of QE was to pump money into the banking system to support economic growth by driving down longer-term interest rates. The weekly chart for the 30-Year U.S. Treasury Bond yield shows that, during QE, the   declined from a high of 4.85% set in April 2010 to a low of 2.09% in July 2016. Even when the QE purchases ended, the policy was to reinvest proceeds of maturing issues, keeping the balance sheet at $4.5 trillion. It was around this time that the Federal Reserve announced its intention to unwind the balance sheet, marking the cycle low for yields. This unwinding began in October 2017. The process began at just $10 billion per month in Q4 2017. In Q1 2018, it jumped to $20 billion per month. In Q2, it jumped to $30 billion per month. In Q3 2018, the pace was $40 billion per month. When the pace rose to its maximum of $50 billion per month in October 2018, the stock began its bear market decline. At that time, the balance sheet stood at $4.193 trillion for a drain of $307 billion. The stock market decline prompted the Federal Reserve to stop raising the   and to ease back on the balance sheet unwinding. The FOMC raised the federal funds rate to 2.25% to 2.50% on Dec. 19, 2018, where it will likely stay for all of 2019. The unwinding of the balance sheet occurs primarily by letting securities mature and not reinvesting the proceeds. I believed that unwinding would last through 2020, but now, given economic and stock market uncertainty, the Federal Reserve may stall at the end of 2019. Looking back at the weekly chart for the 30-Year Treasury yield, note how the 200-week   (in green) is the " " as yields fall, then rise. The rise in yield above the 200-week simple moving average began as 2018 began, and the high yield of 3.46% occurred in November as the monthly unwinding was on a schedule of $50 billion per month. This yield fell back to its 200-week simple moving average at 2.88% as stocks declined and 2019 began. With stocks falling, the Fed unwinding dropped to $30 billion in January, but the pace has picked back up to $50 billion in February. In conclusion, the Federal Reserve will continue to tighten monetary policy by unwinding its balance sheet through the end of 2019 unless there are economic and market dislocations. The federal funds rate will stay at 2.25% to 2.50% as the high end of the Fed's neutral zone of normalization. At the close each Wednesday, the Federal Reserve takes a snapshot of its balance sheet, and the results are updated after 4:00 p.m. on Thursday. Sometimes, this graph is not updated until Friday or Saturday. Wall Street does not focus on this as an economic release, but I actively follow it as an important market-sensitive indicator.

"You'll shoot your eye out!" Think back to when you were a kid. Remember you used hear all these warnings? Looking back now, some of those just seem ridiculous. You know, like "stop jumping on the bed" or "sitting too close to the TV will ruin your eyes." Or silly ones like "don't run into traffic." The truth is, warnings exist as guidelines to help keep us on the path, but they often have ulterior motives. For instance, the military once requested that the FDA do a study on drug effectiveness. The FDA studied 100 prescription and over-the-counter drugs and found that over 90% of them were still effective and safe 15 years after the expiration date. That's right: the dates don't actually indicate if a drug is less effective once it's "expired." The obvious undertone is that the manufacturers sell way more drugs if you're fooled into believing that they are no longer safe and effective. It brings to mind the ongoing argument between my wife and I about food expiration dates. Either way –  is the true mantra of expiration dates. I know I sound like a broken record when I say that the media is fixated on delivering bad news to you. The fact is, unicorns and rainbows don't get people to react and interact – they find fear and loathing to be more effective. So, that brings me to what I am noticing now. We have been talking about how the market has been   since the first day our ratio popped above 80% as of the close Feb. 6. It has now been 21 trading days with the MAP-IT ratio over 80%. This is when the number of unusual institutional buy signals divided by buy + sell signals is more than 80% on a 25-day  . Yet the ratio hit its peak on March 1 at a level of 92.6%. This means that almost 93% of all signals in the trailing five weeks were buys! As the ratio has been declining, it doesn't convey what is really happening every day – the buying has been slowing, and the selling has been picking up. Look at this table here: The green column represents the daily buy signals, while the red is the daily sells. The right-most column is the 25-Day Moving Average (25DMA) of this daily measure. As you can see, it has been dropping over the past few days. But when you look to the column to its left – the one-day ratio – you can see how swiftly the deceleration of buying has been in the past four trading days. Observing this led to the question: how does this overbought period compare with prior periods in our 30-year history? There were 28 prior times that the market stayed overbought for 19 or more trading days. (We posed this question after the 19th trading day of being overbought.) Given the power of our   signal timing market bottoms, we were hopeful of finding the overbought signal to be promising in identifying market tops. What we found was interesting. Long story short – we found the peaks of the 25DMA ratio in each instance and then looked for when the ratio declined for at least five days afterwards. We took the average one- through eight-week returns afterwards. The theory was that, when the ratio started falling from the peak reading, we would see lower market prices ahead. Over the 28 instances in 30 years that fit these criteria, what we actually saw was   ahead. This summarizes the average forward one- to eight-week returns from the ratio dropping from its peak (after five days): Now those returns are the average returns over all those 28 instances. But what we see now are lower prices. Look at the market and sector performances since the ratio peaked on March 1: Now that's a   – no question. On a sector basis, we have seen a rotation from more growth sectors into defensive. Utilities and real estate saw a move higher (as of this writing), while the remaining nine sectors were down for the week thus far. Health care felt the biggest blow, down nearly 4%. Energy, financials, discretionary and info tech were the other worst performers. This is the first week of lower prices in most sectors since the end of 2018. As you can see below, buying slowed significantly, while unusual institutional (UI) sell signals picked up slightly. A giveback is a healthy thing, and now the worriers who fretted about going up too far too fast can begin worrying about going down. Such is the curse of the eternally negative thinker. Trade war fears are back in the headlines.   showed a pretty poor number this Friday, and the political headlines are irksome. The point is, the news cycle has shifted negative gain, and we can see the algorithmic selling starting to react to it, so I expect some bumps ahead. However, given the look back we did over all prior overbought periods, the expectation has to be tempered to expect  In other words, the bull market is still alive. The sales and earnings cycle is nearly complete, with 96% of companies reporting earnings: 70% beat earnings estimates, and 60% beat sales expectations. Those numbers are not discouraging – not in the least. So, as we exit this earnings cycle and hit a pocket of less market-intense news, expect a near-term market burp followed by a resumption of bullish action. The thing about warnings is they are just that: warnings. Take heed in the warnings that come from pessimistic thinkers. Data are strong, but there will always be storm clouds on the horizon. Norman Cousins said, "History is a vast early warning system." We (Mapsignals) continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, but we see a risk of a near-term giveback if institutional selling increases. Selling has started to pick up mildly compared to prior weeks so far this year. Any pullback is a buying opportunity.

Traders soured on the market, sold stocks and bought bonds following a surprisingly pessimistic announcement from the   (ECB) this morning. As I mentioned in yesterday's Chart Advisor newsletter, the ECB was expected to downgrade its economic forecast for the Eurozone in order to justify additional financing for European banks; however, the extent of the central bank's pessimism today was surprising. Unfortunately, the adjusted estimates from ECB President Mario Draghi detailed an expected growth rate of 1.1% this year, which is down 0.6 points from the last estimate. Geopolitical risks such as trade   were to blame for most of the adjustment, which is the lowest estimate since the Greek financial crises prior to 2014. In the following chart, I have used one-minute   to illustrate the reaction traders had to the ECB's announcement on the value of the euro. If you are unfamiliar with the way currencies quotes work, it is important to understand that if the euro is falling, the dollar is rising. As I have mentioned many times over the last few months, a rising dollar is a problem for U.S. equities because it makes U.S. exports more expensive and discounts international profits earned by U.S. multi-nationals, which could extend the current  . What the ECB is essentially planning to do is ease monetary policy by providing more capital to banks in the form of loans from the central bank. Like  , this should lower short-term interest rates, which should be a positive for asset prices, but the ECB's negative tone probably shocked traders a little today. At one point during his press conference, Draghi said, "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are still tilted to the downside." Comments like that hit banks in the region hard, with some, like Deutsche Bank AG ( ), down more than 5% by the close of market. After a short-lived recovery in the middle of today's session, the S&P 500 closed at a new short-term low. It is important to note that today's announcement wasn't entirely new information. It may feel like that from reading the headlines, but traders were already aware of the ECB's plans for bank loans and lowered forecasts. I will argue that the tone in the news is as much a reaction to stock prices that have already been declining since hitting short-term   than any fundamental changes. A worsening Eurozone economy is a risk to the market in the long run, but the pace of the decline is representative of a normal   that happens to coincide with some bad news than a major retracement. In his statement to the press, Mario Draghi also suggested that "vulnerabilities in   appears to be leaving marks on economic sentiment," which may have contributed to additional selling in emerging market indexes. This was unfortunate because one of the areas we have seen surprisingly strong investor sentiment recently has been in emerging markets – especially China. One day does not make a trend, but emerging markets had already failed to make any headway after the   breakout in January. As you can see in the following chart, the iShares Emerging Market ETF ( ) is challenging its breakout point near $42 per share again after failing to break to new highs last week. I wouldn't assume that, if emerging markets break  , the rest of the market will follow; however, weakness in this asset category is a signal for caution. On the other hand, emerging markets frequently provide an early sign that stocks have hit a bottom when they rally. I recommend that traders keep their eye on the asset class for signs of support in the short term to avoid missing out on a new buying opportunity. In tomorrow's Chart Advisor newsletter issue, I will discuss what we learned from the   that will be released before Friday's open. I expressed some concerns in yesterday's issue that traders were being set up for a disappointment when the data is released. However, one advantage of the selling today is that it relieves some of the pricing pressure before the announcement. Lower prices today mean that the market is less likely to fall tomorrow, and buyers may find the low prices attractive once the labor report has been released.

Monday marks the start of first quarter   options expiration week, culminating with Friday's simultaneous expiration of stock options, index options and index futures. This period has a well-deserved reputation for volatility and contrary behavior, setting the stage for a strong bounce that could trap overeager bears. As a result, it's a perfect time to review positions, deciding how aggressively you're willing to play the downside. Major benchmarks turned sharply lower last week after China and the U.S. failed to meet the March trade deadline. Washington DC happy talk has failed to improve sentiment, but triple witching could do the trick, potentially generating an   that has the power to test first quarter highs. The highly regarded   reinforces this bullish view, dropping into the most deeply oversold reading since the Dec. 24 low. Shareholders trapped in losing positions could use the next bounce to get out, so it isn't wise to expect a rapid advance to new highs, even if a trade deal is announced. As a result, traders looking to play a triple witching bounce should maintain tight stops and take profits at predetermined  , while those with longer-term holding periods may choose to place break-even stops and walk away, allowing the market to play its hand. The  posted an all-time high at $293.94 on Sept. 20 and turned lower, finding   at $270.25 at the end of October. A bounce into November reversed twice at the Oct. 17 high above $277, while the decline into December broke six-week support, dropping the fund to the lowest low since April 2017. Buyers returned in force in January, carving a V-shaped pattern that completed a 100%   into October resistance on Feb. 25. A   stretched across the 2018 decline places October resistance at the .786 retracement level, which is notorious for printing lower highs within corrective and topping patterns. The 100% retracement levels mark strong resistance as well, reinforcing a barrier that may not budge in the coming weeks. However, positive sentiment still abounds, supporting a two-sided tape that benefits actively traded short-term positions. The  posted an all-time high at $187.52 on Aug. 30 and carved a lower high on Oct. 1. It broke down from a small   a few sessions later, entering a decline that carved additional lower highs near $178, $175 and $173, ahead of a vertical rout that reached a 15-month low in late December. The bounce into March showed less enthusiasm than the S&P 500, reversing at the November high near $175 last week. The rally stalled between the .618 and .786 Fibonacci retracement levels while failing to reach the Oct. 17  , which has narrowly aligned with the upper retracement level.  The fund bounced at the .618 retracement on Friday, indicating support that could presage a final buying thrust up to $178. As a result, this popular instrument may book greater upside in the coming sessions than its big-cap rival. The   hit an all-time high at $173.39 on Aug. 31 and eased into a modest pullback that escalated into a full-blown sell-off in October. It posted swing highs at $159, $158 and $154 and dropped like a rock into the Dec. 24 two-year low at $125.84. The fund turned higher with other benchmarks in January and posted impressive gains into late February, when it may have topped out at $158.27. This price structure shows similar technical characteristics as SPY and QQQ, reaching the Oct. 16 high while stalling between the .618 and .786 Fibonacci retracement levels. However, the decline into March has broken support at the lower retracement, limiting potential gains during an oversold rally to the $155 level. The fund could reach this barrier late this week if triple witching's typically contrary behavior kicks into gear. Major benchmarks could bounce strongly during triple witching expiration week,   overeager short sellers.

Throughout the week, we've been raising some caution flags about the short-term direction of equities ( ,   and  ). Now that we're seeing some downside follow-through for the first time since December, I wanted to outline a few more potential   setups on an absolute and relative basis. First, let's start with why I'm looking at these sub-sectors to begin with. The S&P Midcap 400 Consumer Discretionary Index is one of the cleanest charts I see out there on an absolute basis, with well-defined risk and   clearly skewed in favor of the bulls. Since there's no   (ETF) to trade this, I had to look through some of the individual components to see how we can best express this thesis in the market. That brought me to the VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF ( ), which is failing to reclaim support near $38.30 as the   catches down to price and  . As long as prices are below that level, the risk is to the downside toward its 2018 lows. In terms of the iShares US Home Construction ETF ( ), what really intrigued me is its chart relative to the   sector as a whole, represented by the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ). Prices recently retested their 2016 lows and a downward-sloping 200-day moving average, unsuccessfully, and are now rolling over again. This suggests continued underperformance from this sub-sector and a great   as long as prices are below their year-to-date highs.

Markets News 
At first blush, the February nonfarm payrolls report, commonly referred to as the monthly "Jobs Report," was far weaker than any forecast. The Labor Department reported Friday that only 20,000 jobs were added last month. Economists had forecast 180,000. Additionally, the unemployment rate fell to 3.8% while average hourly wages grew at annual rate of 3.4%. Strong numbers, to be sure; however, the headline number - that the U.S. economy only added 20,000 jobs - is what gets the most attention. But it may miss the point. The report's calculation of the number of jobs added in a given month is messy to begin with. The data is based off of a survey of about 150,000 businesses and government agencies by the Labor Dept., which asks about their hiring during the past month. The Department then extrapolates from this data the headline number of total jobs added. It's not exact by any means. It is also revised at least once, often twice, in subsequent months as the Bureau of Labor Statistics synthesizes more data. The number of jobs added can vary widely from month to month as well. In January, for example, the U.S. economy added 304,000 jobs. On a three-month average, payrolls have grown by 186,000, which is pretty strong for an economy that is strong, but slowing. Seasonality has something to do with it as well. There were far fewer leisure, construction and hospitality jobs added in February, which makes sense given that fewer people are traveling after the holiday breaks and winter weather always causes a slowdown in homebuilding. We also had a 35-day partial federal government shutdown, which not only affects government employees, but the businesses that support them and their families. Wage growth, which has been stubbornly slow for the past several decades, has been improving. That's obviously good for workers, but it's also a positive for consumer confidence. Average annual earnings grew 0.4% from January to February and 3.4% year-over-year. Wage growth in retail, information, and leisure and hospitality sectors was especially strong. In this context, the overall labor market looks strong, according to John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Research. “While payroll growth has slowed, jobs gains over the past few months have been unexpectedly strong...Labor market strength remains a bright spot in the U.S. economy, and wages are growing at a healthy pace.” Strong growth in is a good sign that there will be support for consumer demand this year, which will help the economy grow at a steady, albeit slower, rate. The Federal Reserve is concerned about the health of the labor market and low inflation. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell has promised patience and backed off from potentially hiking interest rates in 2019, there is now debate forming as to whether the Fed might need to consider a rate cut in 2019. While interest rates are historically low, the central bank is trying to keep the economy from sliding into a prolonged slowdown or a recession. The rate hikes in the second half of 2018 contributed to a correction in the major U.S. stock markets, which promptly reversed as the Fed backed off of plans for future hikes. According to the   tool, there is now a 19.7% chance that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by the end of the year.

Silver prices have fallen in tandem with the price of the precious metal's more glamorous cousin gold over the past week to hit a nine-week low on Monday, March 5. COMEX silver   for May (QI=F) traded at $15.06 on the close yesterday, down over 7% from their 2019 year-to-date (YTD) high of $16.21 set on Jan. 30. After withstanding a return of risk appetite and the subsequent rebound in global equity markets over most of January and February, precious metal prices finally conceded some ground late last month and early this month. Although it's true that the bears have control over silver's short-term price action, that could quickly change if the U.S. jobs report, scheduled for release Friday, disappoints or if a   deal can't be hashed out ahead of the March 29 "leave" date. The gray metal's recent decline puts the price of these three silver   (ETFs) into a   zone that offers an enticing trading opportunity ahead of an upcoming month of uncertainty in the financial markets. Let's look at each fund more closely. Launched in 2006, the passively managed iShares Silver Trust ( ) aims to track the price of silver. The fund provides direct exposure to the precious metal through its holding of silver   stored in a London vault. Traders seeking a vanilla silver fund should look no further than SLV. It has a large asset base of nearly $5 billion, tight   and deep liquidity. The fund's management fee of 0.50% is slightly higher than the 0.34% category average. As of March 6, SLV is down 2.55% on the year. The 50-day   (SMA) crossed above the 200-day SMA, referred to as a  , in mid-February, indicating a change in trend direction to the upside. Since then, the price has retraced back toward a crucial support area around $14. Traders who go long here should place a   just below trendline support and look to book profits near the January and February swing highs at the $15.25 level – offering an excellent   of about 1:4. ($0.25 stop/$1.05 profit target = 1:4.2). The ProShares Ultra Silver ETF ( ) attempts to provide two times the daily performance of the Bloomberg Silver Subindex. It does this by investing in financial instruments such as   agreements, futures contracts and forward contracts. A tight 0.07% spread and average share volume of over 150,000 make this fund a trader's favorite. The ETF's   of 0.95% is pricey but shouldn't overly affect short-term holds. AGQ has   (AUM) of $211.34 million and is down almost 7% YTD as of March 6, 2019. After breaking out from a   pattern in late December's "risk off" market environment, AGQ's share price has traded sideways for most of 2019 to date. The recent pullback into key support between $24 and $25 provides an attractive entry point for swing traders. A nearly oversold   (RSI) reading gives further conviction of an upside reversal in the coming trading sessions. Consider setting a   in the vicinity of last month's high at $28.59, where the price may run into overhead  . Protect trading capital by positioning a stop slightly below the double bottom pattern's neckline. Formed in 2011, the VelocityShares 3x Long Silver ETN ( ) seeks to provide investment results that correspond to three times the daily return of the S&P GSCI Silver index ER. The fund's   makes it suited to traders who want an aggressive short-term bet on rising silver prices. Traders should be aware that the ETF resets each day, which may cause longer-term returns to deviate from its advertised leverage due to  . More than 180,000 shares change hands per day, which provides ample liquidity to enter and exit positions when required. As of March 6, 2019, USLV has net assets of $271.31 million and sports a YTD loss of 10.73%. Like the other silver ETFs analyzed, USLV has recently retraced back into a buy zone created from last year's price action and gained the attention of bulls with a golden cross signal on its chart. Traders who buy "in the zone" between $65 and $70 should look for a move back to the $84 level, where the price may encounter resistance from a   that connects several swing points. Cut losing trades if the fund closes below the zone's lower trendline, as this invalidates the setup.

The   (WTI) crude oil bounce is likely to run out of steam in the coming weeks, giving way to a downturn that could test the deep 2018 low. U.S. energy funds could lose ground at the same time, giving up impressive gains posted since December. Even so, longer-term cycles don't support a breakdown through   at this time, raising the odds that lower prices will generate low-risk trading opportunities. It may be hard to believe, but the crude oil downtrend that started in 2008 is still in force and has now entered its second decade, despite a few years of healthy gains. Sequences of highs and lows determine trends, and the   has carved four lower highs and one lower low since hitting an all-time high at $147.27 in July 2008. The first sign of a trend change now requires an uptick through the low $70s, where the   of lower highs has ended four rallies. A two-year uptrend topped out at $37.80 in 2000, giving way to a decline that ended in the mid-teens in 2001. The contract turned higher into 2002, completing a round trip into the prior high in the first quarter of 2003. Sellers reloaded positions at that level, generating a secondary downturn that posted a higher low at the 50-month   (EMA) a few months later. The subsequent bounce completed a four-year   pattern in 2004, yielding a powerful breakout. The rally stalled in the upper $70s in 2006, ahead of a decline into 2007, followed by a parabolic impulse that added nearly 100 points in 18 months before topping out near $150 in July 2008. The contract plunged during the economic collapse, giving up the last rally wave before finding support on top of the 2004 cup and handle breakout. It finally turned higher in 2009, gaining ground for more than two years before topping out at $115, well below the 2008 peak. Lower highs in 2013 and 2014 generated a lower highs trendline, while selling pressure into the first quarter of 2016 reached a 13-year low in the mid-$20s. The subsequent bounce unfolded in two rally waves, reversing at the trendline in the mid-$70s in October 2018, ahead of a 44% two-month plunge into year end. The contract has bounced into March 2019, recouping less than half of the prior decline. The monthly   posted the deepest oversold technical reading since 2014 at the end of last year and crossed into a buy cycle in January. This tailwind could generate a final uptick into heavy   above $60, marked by a narrow alignment between the 50- and 200-month EMAs as well as the .382   level of the five-year decline into 2016. A reversal from that level could be dangerous, exposing a trip into the 2018 low. The first quarter rally looks less impressive on the daily chart, stuck between the .382 and .50 retracement levels of the fourth quarter decline. Price action is also caught between 50-day EMA support and 200-day EMA resistance, marking neutral territory that favors neither bullish nor bearish positions. A final buying impulse could reach the 200-day EMA, which has also aligned with longer-term moving average resistance. Momentum has waned badly since the second week of January, adding fewer than three points in the past two months. Price action hasn't posted a single higher low since the December low, adding to instability that favors a reversal and retracement, perhaps after a trade deal is finally announced. In any case, there isn't much to do until resistance above $60 is mounted or a decline breaks new support at the 50-day EMA. WTI crude oil may top out soon and enter a renewed decline that could test the 2018 low in the low $40s.

Trading was aimless during today's session as economic and earnings data came in below expectations. While there was plenty of bad news, some of the media's hand-wringing was a great example of post-hoc rationalization. This was particularly true in the energy sector. Each Wednesday, the   (EIA) releases a report of oil inventories held by commercial firms in the U.S. Like most weekly reports, the data can be very "noisy," with wide swings from week to week. In a bullish oil market, we would like to see inventories fall because purchases and shipping are picking up. The weekly oil inventory report swung back hard today to show an increase of 7.1 million barrels versus a decrease of 8.6 million barrels last week. When the two data points are added together, we see a small net decrease over the past two weeks that is more likely to be an accurate reflection of the market. Most traders expected today's news after inventories were reported shockingly low last week. It is normal to see a   and should not be cause for alarm. As you can see in the following chart, oil is down again today, but it is still flat since breaking out of an   pattern on Feb. 15. Reading the headlines might lead you to believe that the oil inventory report is the proximate cause of today's decline, but from a technical perspective, I think that assumption is unjustified. Regardless of the "reason" for oil's decline today, the decline didn't do anything to help the S&P 500 break its own  . The market declined again today after being rejected at short-term resistance in the 2,800 range. I still expect this to be a short-term  , but there are some issues that could contribute to additional selling this week. The U.S. trade balance numbers were released today with a greater deficit than at any point in the past 10 years. Trade data lags other related economic releases, so the numbers weren't a surprise. However, because the U.S./China trade deal is continuing to act as a source of uncertainty, news like this is likely to set traders a little on edge. There are reports that President Trump is pressuring his trade negotiators to complete a deal with China in order to relieve some of that pressure on the markets. That may be a good thing, but it could still be a week or two at best before details are available. My biggest concern for the market's performance this week remains the labor report from the   (BLS) on Friday. ADP, a private payroll and employment management company, reported its own version of the BLS report this morning and missed expectations by a small margin. The ADP and BLS reports are different enough that I wouldn't suggest that this guarantees as big a miss on Friday, but it is very likely to be a disappointment as the data swings lower after huge positive surprises over the past two months. From a risk perspective, I believe that a strong dollar remains the greatest source of uncertainty facing the market. Its strength is one of the reasons the trade balance was so negative over the past few months, and it will likely drag on earnings data in the first quarter. As I mentioned in prior Chart Advisor issues, the problems with a strong dollar are not exclusively due to the Fed's interest rate policy. The other side of the dollar's value is the value of the currencies it is being compared to.   is the dollar's value compared to a trade-weighted basket of other major currencies. More than half of that basket is the euro, British pound and Japanese yen. Therefore, even if investors are neutral on the dollar, if they are very bearish about the euro and pound, the dollar will rise as its counterparts fall. Bloomberg reported today that the   (ECB) will be cutting its growth forecast in an announcement on Thursday morning such that it will be low enough to justify a new round of long-term loans to the big banks in Europe. On the one hand, that is good because European banks are still under significant financial stress following the 2008 financial crisis and   in 2011-2013. On the other hand, this is a sign that European growth is in decline. As a risk indicator, I will be looking for any signs of strength (or worsening weakness) in the big European financial institutions. I think Deutsche Bank AG ( ) would serve this purpose well because its intrinsic financial stability is so poor and therefore should be very sensitive to subtle changes in trader sentiment. As you can see in the following chart, Deutsche Bank stock is stuck at resistance and has just started to turn lower. If the stock reverses and breaks resistance, that would be a "risk-on" signal for the market. Any additional losses will instead eat away further at investor confidence and should be treated as a signal for caution. As I mentioned in Monday's Chart Advisor newsletter, the labor report on Friday is probably the biggest news we will see this week and should set the tone for the month of March. In addition to Friday's report, the latest round of Brexit negotiations with the EU will be over by Sunday night in order to give the U.K. parliament time to vote on the measure on Tuesday. The Tuesday Brexit vote has a good chance of failing, which would then require members to vote on a " " version or " " Brexit on Wednesday. There are a lot of variables at play related to next week's Brexit votes that could worsen the economic outlook for the U.K. and EU, adding further strengthening the dollar. While I remain cautiously biased to the upside in the short term, Brexit and labor will probably keep the major stock indexes flat or negative over the next few trading sessions.

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ( ) has reversed at the .618   level of the 2018 decline and sold off to a three-week low, exhibiting relative weakness compared with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. This marks a bearish turn of events because small caps led broad benchmarks higher in January and February and are now leading to the downside, predicting that larger-cap peers indices will follow suit in the coming sessions. Positive   that has underpinned small-cap leadership tends to wane between March and May, giving way to weak relative performance throughout the summer months. That's an important observation right now because the sector got sold more aggressively than large-cap stocks in last year's second half swoon. As a result, it's logical to assume that the broad market will head much lower if small-cap weakness persists into the second quarter. The Russell 2000 ETF topped out at $85.20 in July 2007 following a multi-year bull run that posted a series of all-time highs. An orderly   escalated into a full-scale panic during the 2008 economic collapse, giving up all but two points of the long-term uptrend before bottoming out at $34.26 in March 2009. The subsequent recovery wave unfolded in two broad buying waves that completed a round trip into the prior high in April 2011. Sellers took control into 2012, but price held well above the prior low, completing the handle of a multi-year   breakout pattern. The fund finally cleared   in 2013 and took off in a strong uptrend that lost steam above $120 in 2014. It then entered a stealth correction, grinding sideways for 15 months before turning sharply lower into the first quarter of 2016. A two-and-a-half-year low in the low $90s marked the bottom, ahead of a bounce into the presidential election. The fund and index broke out to new highs in November 2016 and eased into a shallow rally trajectory one month later, with IWM posting gains into the June 2018 high at $170.20. It rallied above that resistance level in August, added three points and trapped bulls in major decline that dumped the fund more than 27% in less than four months. It bounced at a two-year low into 2019, recouping more than half the loss into early March. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator posted an all-time high with price in August and entered an aggressive distribution phase that reached a 13-month low in December. Buying interest into March has been proportional to price gains, generating neither bullish nor bearish  . All in all, this contributes to a neutral outlook and an expectation for range-bound action into the foreseeable future. A Fibonacci grid stretched across the uptrend that started in 2016 shows the 2018 decline stretched across the .50 retracement into the .618 retracement level in December, yielding a V-shaped recovery wave that completed a 100% retracement into the October   (upper blue line) on Feb. 25. The fund reversed at that resistance level in the following session and has now undercut the 200-day   (EMA). Watch the lower blue line at $145 if selling pressure continues in the coming weeks because a strong bounce starting near that level might carve the right shoulder of an   pattern, with a breakout targeting a new bull market high. Conversely, there are few  below that line in the sand, increasing the odds that a breakdown will generate downside into the 2018 low. Bearish Russell 2000 price action has issued preliminary   that could presage a larger-scale correction into the second quarter.

With 96% of the S&P 500 components having reported their quarterly numbers, the Q4 2018   is almost over. It has been a surprisingly good earnings season. Many analysts were wondering if the numbers were going to hold up, but they have. Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported, 69% have beaten earnings expectations and 61% have beaten revenue expectations (according to  ). While these aren't the best numbers we've ever seen – the earnings numbers are slightly below the five-year average, while the revenue numbers are slightly above the five-year average – they are not concerning either. In fact, if the blended earnings growth rate of 13.1% for the quarter holds until the remaining 4% of the S&P 500 companies have officially announced, it will be the fifth straight quarter of double-digit earnings for the index. Not too shabby. When you break down the earnings performance by sector, only one sector failed to have more than half of its companies deliver earnings above estimates: the real estate sector. The information technology sector led the way with 85% of its companies beating estimates, while the industrials, consumer discretionary and health care sectors were not far behind with 80%, 79% and 77% of their companies reporting earnings that were above estimates, respectively. The S&P 500 bounced back from three consecutive down days to close out the week on a positive note today. By closing at 2,803.69, the index enjoyed its highest close since Nov. 8, 2018. The S&P 500 had a higher intra-day high on Feb. 25, but the index closed below 2,800 that day.  at 2,816.94 is still firmly in place, but with the potential for good news coming out of the trade negotiations between the United States and China, we may see the S&P 500 breaking through in March.   Earlier this week, we got our first look at the Q4 2018   (GDP), and the numbers were much better than expected – coming in at a growth rate of 2.6% instead of the consensus estimate of 2.2%. Unfortunately, our first peek at the   estimate for Q1 2019 GDP isn't nearly as rosy. The Atlanta Fed maintains an indicator it calls   that tracks the group's estimates of what the GDP growth rate for the current quarter is going to be. The analysts at the Atlanta Fed update their estimates whenever new economic data – like   (PCE), the   (CPI) or trade balance numbers – are released. This indicator is far from perfect. Early estimates never tell you what the Final GDP is going to be for the quarter. Even late estimates that get issued right before the Advance GDP number is announced for the quarter can come in too high or too low. However, while it may not be useful for predicting exactly what the GDP number is going to be, GDPNow is helpful for gauging market expectations. On Wall Street, expectations are everything. If expectations are bullish, the stock market is going to move higher. If expectations are bearish, the stock market is going to move lower. Looking at the GDPNow chart, you can see that the first print of the Atlanta Fed's expectations for Q1 2019 GDP growth is woefully low at a measly 0.3%. This is well below the Blue Chip consensus estimate of 1.9%. While this number could eventually get revised higher if more positive economic data comes out, it sets an initial bearish expectation on Wall Street of paltry growth during the current quarter. I've discussed two apparently contradictory indicators today. On one hand, I've highlighted strong earnings growth among S&P 500 components during Q4 2018. On the other hand, I've highlighted concerns about weak economic growth in Q1 2019. While these two items may seem to be at odds, they don't necessarily have to be. Even if the U.S. economy doesn't grow at a stellar rate this quarter, corporate America may still be able to deliver strong earnings growth in Q1 if it can continue to widen margins. Even if top-line revenues don't grow as quickly as traders may want them to, it doesn't mean bottom-line earnings can't increase. It all depends on what happens on the   between the top line and the bottom line. Let's see if management teams can continue to increase efficiency and productivity to boost earnings this quarter even if revenue growth slows down.

Commentators have gone into overdrive discussing what impact a "no deal"   outcome would have on the United Kingdom, but how would this scenario impact the   (EU)? According to the   (IMF), economic growth would constrict up to 1.5% across the remaining EU states by 2030 if a deal can't be reached between Westminster and Brussels before the March 29 "leave date" deadline. Although EU-U.K. trade is smaller relative to the EU economy than it is to Britain's, a no deal Brexit coincides with the worst economic slowdown in Europe since the euro crisis of 2011 and 2012. If the EU economy took a turn for the worse, the bloc's central bank, the   (ECB), has limited policy options at its disposal with an already negative deposit interest rate. Despite the genuine possibility of a hard landing Brexit, it's appearing more likely that British Prime Minister Theresa May's revised Brexit deal will succeed, provided that see gives assurance that the Irish backstop, an insurance policy that ensures there is no hard border in Ireland, would only be temporary. "As long as the attorney general [Sir Geoffrey Cox] is able to assure the House that he has a legally binding guarantee that the backstop can only be temporary, I would accept that and would urge others to accept it," prominent conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Sir Graham Stuart Brady said,  . Critics of the backstop, a sticking point in the first failed Brexit deal, believe that it could leave the United Kingdom indefinitely tied to the European Union from a customs perspective. From a technical standpoint, these three European country   (ETFs) have found buying support in recent trading sessions, suggesting that the market is betting against a no deal Brexit outcome. Let's consider several trading ideas as negotiations continue. Created back in 1996, the iShares MSCI Germany ETF ( ) aims to track the price and yield performance of the MSCI Germany Index. The fund, which holds 67 stocks, provides exposure to German mid-cap and large-cap companies with a tilt toward the financials and   sectors. Significant allocations include SAP SE ( ) at 8.82%, Allianz SE (AZSEY) at 8% and Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (SIEGY) at 7.07%. EWG appeals to traders with its sizable $2.33 billion asset base and razor-thin   of just 0.04%. As of March 4, 2019, the fund charges a moderate   of 0.47%,   2.77% and is up 7.69% on the year. EWG's share price has formed an   pattern over the past four months that indicates a bottom may be in place. The fund closed above the pattern's neckline on Friday, March 1, which provides breakout traders with a swing trading opportunity. Those who go long here should look for an initial move to between $28.50 and $29, where the price may encounter   from the 200-day   (SMA) and a trendline connecting the August and September 2018 swing lows. Consider placing a   just below the breakout level to protect against a sudden reversal. With net assets of over $45 million, the iShares MSCI Belgium Capped ETF ( ) provides similar returns to the MSCI Belgium IMI 25/50 Index. The fund's top holding – Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV ( ), the makers of Budweiser and Corona – accounts for over 20% of the  . Bank insurer KBC Group NV (KBCSY) claims the next highest allocation at 10.33%. The ETF's average spread of 0.19% is a little wider than EWG's, but average daily   of nearly $500,000 provides ample liquidity to enter and exit positions. EWK has a year-to-date (YTD) return of 10.10% as of March 4, 2019. The fund charges a 0.47% management fee and pays a   of 2.56%. Like EWG, the fund's share price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern over a four-month period. Traders who buy Friday's breakout should be mindful that the price is approaching the 200-day SMA, where it may find some overhead resistance. The   (RSI) gives a reading of nearly 67.69, also suggesting short-term overbought conditions. If the fund pushes through this level, however, look for a test of other key resistance areas at $19.25 and $20.40. Protect open positions with a stop just below the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. The Global X MSCI Greece ETF ( ), formed in 2011, seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI All Greece Select 25/50 Index. The benchmark represents the broad Greece equity universe. To be included in the underlying index, companies must be headquartered or listed in Greece and carry out the majority of their operations in the southern European country. GREK's top 10 holdings command a cumulative allocation of 60%, making its portfolio relatively concentrated. Top stocks in the basket include Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. (HLTOY), Alpha Bank A.E. (ALBKF) and Greek Organization of Football Prognostics S.A. (GOFPY). The fund provides adequate liquidity and reasonable spreads for traders who think the country's   is well behind it. GREK, with   (AUM) of $239.14 million and offering a 2.29% dividend, is up over 14% YTD as of March 4, 2019. The ETF's chart looks the most promising of the three, with a   pattern forming between October and February. The pattern's second swing low made a lower low, while the RSI indicator's second swing low made a higher low – referred to as a bullish  , giving further conviction to the bulls. Traders should look for a pullback entry at the $7.75 level, where price finds support from the double bottom pattern's neckline. Think about positioning a   near $8.75 – an area the fund may run into resistance from a   stretching back across previous price action. Place a stop under the February low to protect trading capital.

Sometimes, things are no-brainers – an event's outcome might come along that's just a forgone conclusion. Even with a "sure thing" comes the chance of a completely unexpected conclusion. Amazing upsets come to mind, like in Super Bowl XLII, when the then perfect, yet-to-be-defeated New England Patriots fell to the 10-6 New York Giants. Or when against-the-odds Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson. Or how about the time that Australia declared war on a bunch of birds? I mean, what could go wrong? In depression-ravaged 1932, Australian farmers were against the ropes. Their crops were delicate enough as it was, but it was a bunch of large flightless birds that pushed them over the edge. The emu, a smaller cousin to the ostrich, is endemic to Australia. And these birds went to town on the farmers’ crops. Facing enough of a hardship already, the farmers pleaded to the government for help. What did the government do in response? Why, what any rational entity would do –  . They armed soldiers with machine guns mounted on trucks to cull the birds in an effort to reduce the destruction. The soldiers tried and tried, but the birds were just too good at scattering and evading certain death. After a week and thousands of rounds of ammunition, "only a few birds" were killed. George Pearce, then defense minister, withdrew, and the great Emu War ended in failure. It was a stunning upset for emus: A continent declared war on some birds and lost. I've lamented the   assumption late last year. Yet here we are, and it's quite the opposite. Markets have rallied immensely since Christmas Eve lows, led by small caps and  . These were the toxic untouchables that were threatening to take out the market. However, the Russell 2000 Growth Index is up nearly 30% since its lows. The   is up 27.5%. When was the last time you saw an S&P 500 rally of 19% in a few weeks? Industrials, tech, energy, discretionary and financials have been leading the surge. There is a lot of growth concentrated in these sectors. The bears had their "war against emus," and they also lost, for now. So, what's the setup like now? Well, logic dictates that we have gone up too far too fast. We should   soon. We have been hearing some iteration of this daily for weeks now as well. Let me share some thoughts on the market. We are definitely  , but we can stay that way for a while, as long as buying continues. Let's look where the buying has been focused. As far as where we have seen unusual buying this past week, health is king.   accounted for half the buy signals, while lesser concentrations were seen in health care equipment and pharmaceuticals. This is interesting because the overall Health Care Sector Index is up only slightly for the week. Information technology is up 98  . As of Friday, we have seen 118 signals of buying in infotech. These signals were spread evenly across semiconductors, software and communications equipment companies. This big tech buying was only slightly overshadowed by health care. Financials saw 69 buy signals, also spread evenly across industries, with the highest concentration in insurance companies. Consumer discretionary saw 67 buy signals, again evenly distributed with only a slight bump in media and specialty retail companies. Finally, industrials saw 61 buys similarly distributed throughout all industries. Selling was once again scarce at best. The only selling even coming close to worthy of mention was 14 sells in consumer staples companies. There is simply no selling to speak of. So what does this mean? Everyone can pretty much conclude that the market is due for a backup. But the data suggests that buying is alive and well under the surface. So, despite what we see in a ho-hum week for the broader indexes, there is continued strength under the surface. I especially like this show of quiet strength in the face of a negative news week. The North Korea summit collapse and the Michael Cohen testimony had more than a few people checked out this week as they focused on the juicy news stories. When negative headlines can't bring a market down, it means there is a stable ballast of   in the form of buying underneath. That's what I see here. Let's hammer the point home right now. After tallying only four trading days worth of data last week, I saw 395 unusual institutional buy signals and only 35 sell signals. Buying is still going full force. This means we can stay overbought for a while to come. Our ratio that measures a   of buying to selling will start falling only when we see some buying abate and some selling pick up. That hasn't happened at all yet. In fact, as you can see, it's still overwhelming buying. And it's happening in small-cap and mid-cap growth-oriented names. The markets came screaming back and have to let off some steam – or do they That's where we are now. The trend says buying is alive and thriving. We need to pay attention to when buying slows and selling begins to properly call a turn in the market. We are just not there yet. We may be tomorrow or next week or even next month, but for now, we ride the tide. The market is a lot like surfing – your passion for it has to be more than your fear of sharks. The trends of the market ebb and flow like waves, and the surfer's main goal is to read the ocean, adapt and adjust. I think the markets are the same. The surf is telling us there's a wave at our backs. Famed surfer Laird Hamilton said, "Surfing's one of the few sports that you look ahead to see what's behind." We (Mapsignals) continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, but we see a risk of a near-term giveback if institutional selling increases. Selling has been non-existent thus far in 2019. We see the year-to-date lift in stocks as very constructive. As growth stocks gain on increasing volumes, we believe that earnings season could be better than overall expectations.

General Electric Company ( ) has been a cautionary tale on Wall Street ever since it was dropped from the   on June 19, 2018. GE was one of the original stocks in the index when it was first created in 1896, but years of underperformance and a lack of managerial vision eventually forced the index overseer's hand, and it ousted the company and replaced it with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( ). GE stock continued to fall after leaving the Dow, but after reaching a multi-year low of $6.40 on Dec. 11, 2018, the conglomerate finally started to right the ship and turn things around. GE stock   for a few weeks and eventually formed a   bullish reversal pattern that it completed on Jan. 31 when the stock gapped higher after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. This " " – a gap that forms during an uptrend or a downtrend without getting filled – formed a solid support level that allowed GE to consolidate for nearly a month during February until the stock once again gapped higher. Many traders were hoping this gap would prove to be another "runaway gap," but unfortunately for the GE bulls, the stock collapsed in mid-day trading today when CEO Larry Culp announced that the company's   will be "in negative territory" this year. The stock was able to rebound up off of its intraday lows, but the bearish move filled the gap that formed on Feb. 25, which officially makes the gap an " ." Exhaustion gaps often mark the end of bullish moves. If that is the case for GE, the price level just below $11 that served as support in late September 2018 and as resistance in late February could prove a difficult level to crack in the short term. While many traders are frustrated that the S&P 500 is still consolidating and still struggling to break above short-term resistance at 2,816.94 – the high the index reached on Oct. 17, 2018 – I think it is important to acknowledge the longer-term gains the index has made during the past decade. The S&P 500 bottomed out 10 years ago on March 6, 2009, at 666.79. Today's close of 2,789.65 is 318% higher than that dreadfully low level the index dropped to in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis of 2008. The fact that the S&P 500 is within spitting distance of the index's all-time high of 2,940.91 (reached on Sept. 21, 2018) is also remarkable considering the S&P 500 officially entered bearish territory last Christmas Eve. It is important to note that the S&P 500's rise from 666.79 to 2,940.91 wasn't without its hiccups and pullbacks. The 12 months from early 2015 through early 2106 were a tumultuous time on Wall Street. Many traders were sure that the market had put in a top and was ready to collapse back down to retest the 2007 high of 1,576.09 to see if the former resistance level would hold up as a longer-term support level. As you can see, we never found out if that level would hold as support because the market rallied instead of falling. Seeing this resilience tells us there is still a chance for the S&P 500 to continue on to even higher highs. It will take some strong earnings and economic numbers to push the index higher, but seeing those numbers is still well within the realm of possibility during 2019. I've discussed this before, but one indicator I like to use to gauge trader sentiment on Wall Street is a   comparison chart between the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ) and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ). The relative strength comparison chart shows which stock, or exchange-traded fund (ETF) in this case, is outperforming and which stock, or ETF, is underperforming. In this setup, where I am looking at an XLY/XLP relative strength chart, any upward movement in the chart indicates that XLY is outperforming XLP, and any downward movement in the chart indicates that XLY is underperforming XLP. Watching this chart can help you tease out a better understanding of what current trader sentiment is because   stocks tend to outperform   stocks when trader sentiment is bullish. Traders typically look to put their money in more aggressive stocks when they are confident. Conversely, consumer discretionary stocks tend to underperform consumer staples stocks when trader sentiment is bearish. Traders typically look to put their money in more conservative stocks when they are less confident. Looking at the XLY/XLP relative strength chart, you can see that consumer discretionary stocks are outperforming consumer staples, with the chart confirming the completion of a new bullish   continuation pattern today. Positive earnings numbers and bullish expectations for the trade negotiations between the United States and China seem to be driving most of the bullish sentiment. While it has been frustrating to sit and watch the S&P 500 consolidate below resistance for the past few weeks, it shouldn't be discouraging. At this point, any non-bearish movement should be considered bullish since we have shaken off the specter of last year's bearish pullback and re-entered a new bullish uptrend.

March will be jam-packed with geopolitical events that will dictate the investing landscape for the rest of 2019 and beyond, with the two biggest being Brexit and the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. U.S. markets have experienced a broad and swift recovery after the correction of late 2018. The S&P 500 is up 19% since its December 24  lows, but still hasn't hit its 2018 highs. It's worth noting that as we end the month in positive territory, history suggests markets usually continue to rise in years where first two months were positive, according to research from LPL Financial. Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist for LPL says, “since 1950, the S&P 500 has kicked off the year higher each of the first two months 27 times… incredibly, the final 10 months finished higher 25 of those times!” As we know, past performance is never indicative of future returns. Given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the trade talks, anything can happen. Here’s a look ahead at what to expect in March 2009. The deadline for Great Britain to officially leave the European Union is March 29th, but it's been a bumpy road to get to where we are today. Citizens of the U.K. voted for Brexit on June 23, 2016, with those voting in favor narrowly edging those who voted to remain. Since then, Prime Minister Theresa May, who originally voted against Brexit, has changed course to support the will of the voters. May survived several "No Confidence" votes from Parliament, cabinet defections from her own party and the loss of a political majority in the House of Commons in 2017. Still, she has persevered, even as the opposition Labour party has opposed May’s Brexit plan at every step. There are a number of possibilities for what might happen on or before March 29 . There articles will bring you up to speed: The original deadline for the U.S. and China to reach an agreement on trade and tariff issues was March 1, but President Trump recently announced that the deadline would be pushed back as negotiations continue between the two countries’ trade representatives. Increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports were to go into effect on March 1 , but that shouldn't happen as long as the two sides continue to iron out the details of an agreements.  A potential sticking point in the negotiations is U.S. insistence on the prevention of intellectual and technological property theft by China and the enforcement of rules around it. The arrest and extradition to the U.S. of Huawei’s CFO, who is accused of supplying telecom equipment and services to Iran via Russia, has also been a point of contention between the two countries, complicating the overall trade agreement. President Trump and members of his administration continue to indicate that progress is being made on the overall agreement, which has helped prop up the stock markets of both countries since the year began. As they say, though, "the devil is in the details," and we will be following these stories closely for more throughout the month. Industrial stocks like Caterpillar  , Deere   and 3M   have all been sensitive the back and forth negotiations between the two countries, but have been on an upswing over the past month as both countries have highlighted progress on the talks. In the U.S., there are several upcoming economic reports that will give us a good look at strength of the job market, consumer confidence, the housing market and direction on interest rates. On March 1 , we will get reports from the U.S Dept. of Commerce on Personal Income, consumer spending (from December, given the government shutdown) and core inflation. Consumer spending makes up 70% of gross domestic product in the U.S., so the health of the American buyer is core to continued growth. Inflation has been trending lower than the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%. As the Fed has changed course on raising rates in 2019. This could prompt Powell and Co. to rethink their plans to keep interest rates at 2.25%-2.50% when it meets on March 20th. Job creation in the U.S. has remained relatively strong over the past several months, especially in January when over 300,000 jobs were created. That number could be revised next week when the Labor Dept. reports non-farm payrolls on March 8th, but the trend has been robust. The Federal Open Market Committee will meet next on March 20th on interest rates. Chairman Jay Powell and the Committee have reversed course on interest rates from the end of December into 2019. They had previously indicated that they planned at least two rate hikes in 2019, but changed their tune as the stock market abruptly corrected last November and December. The FOMC's tune has since been one of patience as the global economy has slowed and capital markets have shuddered. In recent remarks, Powell and other Fed governors have continued to take a "wait and see," approach, as Brexit and the trade negotiations play out. They will not be the only ones waiting for resolution on those key issues. Buckle up for an intense month.

Stocks have jumped out of the gate in the first two months of the year, clawing back the lion's share of last year's steep third quarter losses. In particular,   such as technology, energy and real estate have seen substantial inflows as investors cheer a more   Federal Reserve, ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, and a round of quarterly earnings that have exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Also, the chances of the economy slipping into recession look to have reduced. "Because the markets weakened and Fed officials now see that the economy and inflation are weak, there has been a shift to an easier stance," wrote Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, a Connecticut-based  . "I have lowered my odds of a U.S. recession coming prior to the U.S. presidential election to about 35%," he continued,  . Those who want to take advantage of 2019's top performing sectors should consider using   (ETFs) that are specifically designed to magnify short-term price movements. For example, if an index comprising technology stocks is up 1%, a tracking leveraged ETF providing three times exposure would be up 3%. Traders should be aware that leveraged ETFs reset daily – therefore, returns over a holding period of more than one day may not reflect the fund's advertised leverage due to compounding effects. Let's consider several trading ideas relating to leveraged sector ETFs. Created in 2008, the Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X ETF ( ) seeks to provide three times the daily return of the Technology Select Sector Index. The benchmark index consists of U.S. large-cap technology names such as Apple Inc. ( ), Microsoft Corporation ( ) and Google parent company Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL). The fund's tight 0.08% average   and daily turnover of more than 400,000 shares make it a suitable instrument for all forms of short-term trading. TECL, with   (AUM) of $550.57 million and offering a 0.39%  , is up 45.76% year to date (YTD) as of Feb. 28, 2019. The ETF charges a 1.17% management fee, which has a minimal impact on short stays. After bottoming out at $68.96 in late December, TECL's share price has rallied almost 80% to close at $123.56 on Feb. 27. Traders who want to capitalize on this strongly trending market should look for entry points on pullbacks to the 20-day   (SMA). If the fund's price continues higher, the SMA can then be used as a   to let profits run. Those who hold open positions should consider moving the stop to the breakeven point when the price nears $130 – an area where it may find   from the 200-day SMA. The Direxion Daily Energy Bull 3X ETF ( ), with net assets that exceed $400 million, aims to return three times the daily investment results of the Energy Select Sector Index. Energy sector heavyweights Exxon Mobil Corporation ( ) and Chevron Corporation ( ) dominate the underlying index, carrying a cumulative weighting of 41.75%. Tight spreads and deep   make this ETF an energy trader's favorite. The fund yields 2.29% and has an   of just over 1%. As of Feb. 28, 2019, ERX has returned 46.27%. The ERX share price fell off a cliff in the fourth quarter of 2018, following oil prices sharply lower. The fund bottomed in late December on climactic volume and has since tracked higher with only minor retracements. Those who wish to ride the upward momentum should enter on   to $22, where the price finds a confluence of support from a two-month uptrend line and 20-day SMA. Traders could set   at key resistance levels such as $26 and $32. Close open positions if the price falls much below the trendline, as this invalidates the short-term momentum setup. Launched in 2009, the Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull 3x ETF ( ) attempts to replicate three times the daily performance of MSCI US REIT Index. The fund, with AUM of $43.66 million, suits traders who want an aggressive play in equity   (REITs). It tilts more toward commercial REITs than the tracked index but still provides ample exposure to residential real estate. Top allocations in the benchmark include Simon Property Group, Inc. ( ) at 6.61%, Prologis, Inc. ( ) at 4.70% and Public Storage ( ) at 4.04%. A 0.63% average spread may eat too much into profits for   but shouldn't overly affect swing traders who can let winning trades run over several days to cover slightly higher trading costs. DRN charges a management fee of 1.09% and has returned 41.86% YTD as of Feb. 28, 2019. DRN shares rallied above their August 2018 peak earlier this month but have recently backed away from those highs to provide a swing trading opportunity. The fund's price should find solid   at the current price from a horizontal line that connects the July and December swing highs. Traders may want to wait for a reversal candlestick pattern, such as   or piercing line, to confirm that upward momentum has resumed before opening a position. Think about placing a   under this month's low and booking profits on a test of the 2016 high at $28.64.

Given all of the major, potentially market-moving events and conditions we're expecting in the month ahead, here are the key charts and price levels that investors should be watching in March 2019. Markets move based on a wide variety of macroeconomic and political factors. Among the most important and heavily anticipated of these factors slated for March will be: the monthly U.S. jobs report, the Federal Reserve's next FOMC decision, Brexit Day, and a likely U.S.-China trade summit at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. In one way or another, the five charts featured below will be impacted by one or more of these factors. This is an obvious one. In case you haven't been following developments coming out of Europe, Brexit Day is fast approaching. This is the date - March 29 - when the U.K. is supposed to leave the European Union. Of course, there's been massive political chaos in the run-up to this date, and we still don't know whether Brexit will go on as planned, will be delayed, or will just fail altogether. What ultimately happens is almost certain to make a large impact on the British pound, just like the original Brexit referendum in mid-2016 did. Recently, the pound rallied against both the euro and the dollar after UK Prime Minister Theresa May promised Members of Parliament the possibility of delaying Brexit until a deal can be agreed upon between the UK and EU. Generally, the pound has fallen on fears of a hard (or "no-deal") Brexit, while the currency has rallied on the prospects of a Brexit delay or another public referendum. From a technical perspective, the chart above shows the GBP/USD (British pound vs U.S. dollar) generally on a rebound from its December and January double-bottom lows. Since those lows, GBP/USD has risen well above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and has climbed up to hit key resistance around the 1.3300 level. The weeks ahead leading up to the scheduled Brexit Day will be critical in determining the direction of the pound. Any sign of a Brexit deal or a delay should be positive for GBP/USD. A breakout above the noted 1.3300 resistance level would be significantly bullish, potentially leading the way towards 1.3700. The 10-year yield has been falling since it double-topped around 3.250% in October and November. This drop has occurred as the Federal Reserve has become increasingly concerned about economic growth. During this time, the Fed's language and decisions have become progressively more dovish and hesitant in raising interest rates further. The expected interest rate trajectory has therefore become much less steep than it had been last year. In March, both the next major FOMC decision on March 20 and the monthly U.S. non-farm payrolls jobs report on March 8 could play a major role in the direction of the 10-year yield. As of the beginning of March, the futures markets are overwhelmingly pricing-in no rate hike from the Fed (more than 98%). Clearly, in the exceptionally unlikely event that we do get a rate hike then, the 10-year yield could surge sharply. In the absence of that happening, the yield will likely continue its downtrend given the increasing concerns over the economy and global growth. In March, if the yield remains below the 2.800% resistance level, lower interest rate expectations could pressure the 10-year yield towards the 2.500% level and below. At the very beginning of March, the price of gold fell sharply, but much of that was due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Prior to this drop, gold had been on a sharp rally since its mid-August lows around $1160. There were a few factors helping to boost the price of gold during that time. One of these factors, already mentioned, was falling interest rates as shown in the U.S. Treasury 10-year yield since November. When interest rates fall, non-interest-bearing gold has less competition from interest-bearing instruments. So gold prices and demand for gold tend to rise. Also, gold is considered a safe-haven investment, which means investors buy gold when concerns or fears about global political and economic conditions increase. As noted, there are many potential risk factors in March and on the horizon. Concerns about U.S.-China trade negotiations, Brexit, and slowing global economic growth could continue to boost the price of gold. As of the first day of March, the drop in gold has tentatively pressured price below its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. But with interest rate expectations falling and key risk factors looming, gold is likely to recover. With any climb back above the $1300 level, the next major upside target is around $1360, which represents last year's highs. As equity markets have made a dramatic rebound and recovery from late December lows, the Volatility Index, or VIX, has come down sharply from its highs. The VIX, also known as the "fear gauge," is a primary measure of fear and volatility in the markets as measured by S&P 500 index options volatility. As shown on the VIX chart, the big December spike in volatility mirrors the big December drop in stock prices. But the VIX is well known for falling back rather rapidly after such overdone fear spikes, and December was no exception. By January, the VIX had fallen below its 50-day moving average, which is currently around the 19.50 level. And by February, below its 200-day moving average, which is currently around 16.50. As of the beginning of March, the VIX briefly broke down to a new low not seen since October. While this shows a high level of complacency in the markets at the current time, the risk factors on the horizon remain. Particularly in March, U.S.-China trade, Brexit, the Fed decision, and slowing economic growth could all play a role in boosting the VIX once again. We've mentioned U.S.-China trade multiple times, and for good reason. It's on the minds of investors. Not only have recently positive developments in trade negotiations between President Trump and Chinese President Xi helped boost U.S. markets, but they've also done wonders for the Chinese markets. The Shanghai Composite is an index of all stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which is the largest stock exchange in China. From its early January double-bottom low, the Shanghai Composite has risen a full 22% (as of the 3/1/2019 market close) - not a small feat for an index. This even beats the performance of the S&P 500 in the same time period. In the process, the Shanghai index has climbed sharply above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Again, March will be critical for the SSEC, with the planned summit between Trump and Xi slated for late March at Trump's Mar-a-Lago. With any further positive developments between the two Presidents in March, the Shanghai Composite is likely to further its rally. The next major resistance level to the upside is around the 3,045 level. With any breakout above that level, the next major bullish target is around 3,220.

The government shutdown that lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019 – the longest is U.S. history – is still having an impact on the financial markets at the end of February. The impact was felt today as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) was finally able to release the United States'   (GDP) numbers for Q4 2018 … a full month behind schedule. During a typical quarter, the BEA will release the following three GDP estimates: However, this quarter is different because the federal government was shut down during most of January. Since the BEA staff did not have a chance to compile the Q4 2018 data during January, the agency decided to wait a month, gather the data and combine the advance estimate with the preliminary estimate. This delay gave traders and analysts an additional month to stew and wonder what the number was going to be. While virtually everyone anticipated that GDP was going to continue contracting from the 4.2% growth rate the economy experienced during Q2 and the 3.4% growth rate it experienced in Q3, many thought it was going to contract more than it did. The consensus estimate for Q4 was hovering right around 2.2%, but the U.S. economy surprised to the upside with a 2.6% growth rate. When you combine this strong Q4 number with the rest of 2018, you see that the U.S. economy had its best year since 2005, before the Great Recession of 2009. Even if economic growth were to slow down a little in 2019, we would still likely have enough growth to continue fueling much of the bullish momentum that exists on Wall Street. Interestingly, while many other financial assets reacted to the surprising Q4 2018 GDP news this morning, the S&P 500 seems to have shrugged it off. The stock index barely moved at all – closing only 0.28% lower today, at 2,784.49 – as traders dug a little deeper into the GDP numbers and discovered that   slowed down in Q4. Consumer spending is an important economic indicator on Wall Street, especially for   stocks. The news of a slowdown in spending wasn't enough to send traders running for the hills, but it did give them pause. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ) pulled back 0.54% today. I'll be watching these consumer discretionary stocks to see what they do during the next few weeks. If they start to sell off, the S&P 500 is not likely to break through   at 2,816.94. One asset class that did react strongly to the GDP announcement was  . Stronger-than-expected growth numbers caused bond traders to worry that they hadn't priced in enough   in the Treasury purchase as of late. When economic growth is strong, inflationary pressures tend to increase. When these pressures increase, it escalates the risk that the Federal Reserve will need to take action to curb excessive inflation by raising interest rates. This typically causes traders to push longer-term   higher by pushing Treasury prices lower, like we saw today. The 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) broke convincingly out of the   range it has been in since mid-January today as the indicator broke above its downtrending resistance level. This breakout confirms the formation of a bullish   reversal pattern and clears the way for the TNX to climb back up toward its recent highs of 2.8%. While the TNX is still well below the magical 3% level market analysts have been watching for years, seeing an increase in the TNX is likely to apply some bearish pressure to the stock market as strong dividend-paying stocks may lose some of their attractiveness compared to rising Treasury yields. It's only likely to apply a modest amount of bearish pressure at the moment, but it will be worth watching as we head into March.

After President Trump postponed the   that U.S. importers would have had to pay on $200 billion of Chinese goods beginning on March 2, the S&P 500 hit a new short-term high today. However, a new tariff deadline or a schedule for meetings with Chinese President Xi were not provided by President Trump via his Twitter feed. The initial rally in U.S. equities faded through the rest of the day as interest rate-sensitive sectors like utilities and real estate declined. However, Chinese stock indexes continued to have the best day since 2015 following the trade news. As you can see in the following chart, the Shanghai Composite Index reached its full   based on the depth of the   pattern formed in January. The worst performing sectors and stocks in the S&P 500 included just about anything paying a larger than average   like consumer staples, utilities and   (REITs). I would have expected concentrated selling among income stocks to be triggered by rising interest rates. Like bond payments, dividend income is less valuable when interest rates rise; that's because the price of stocks that pay a dividend fall. However, long-term interest rates were only slightly lower for the day, which makes the selling in income sectors look like the first part of a short-term  . Unless the outlook for interest rates shifts, I would expect these same stocks to pop back up over the next two trading sessions. As you can see in the following chart, the S&P 500 is still struggling against the short-term   I pointed out in Friday's issue of the Chart Advisor newsletter. If we see more definitive news about a timeline when the U.S./China trade deal will be settled, I would expect the major stock indexes to break resistance.   From a risk perspective, the outperformance of technology and industrial stocks in the U.S. is a positive sign for the market. However, there appears to be a bias to the downside in oil, which could become more of a concern in the short term if prices continue to fall. Along with comments on his Twitter feed about the U.S./China trade deal, President Trump seems to have triggered the sell-off in oil early Monday morning by writing, "Oil prices getting too high.  , please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike – fragile!" to his Twitter followers and the media. It's not unexpected for statements by any U.S. president to have an impact on the market, but   (WTI) oil prices dropped a surprising 3.3%. I believe investors should be concerned about the magnitude of the reaction to President Trump's tweet. This reminds me of a similar tweet on Nov. 12, 2018, when prices were already in decline. The losses accelerated, with prices of WTI bottoming out near $42 per barrel. Lower commodity prices can be a good thing for the economy, but there can be unexpected consequences as well. The energy sector is a significant percentage of the non-consumption portion of the U.S. economy. The "earnings  " of 2015 was largely driven by a collapse in oil prices that began in 2014. Besides the complicated relationship oil prices have with the U.S. economy, what today's reaction tells me is that investors have a bias toward taking some of the short-term gains off the table in the energy sector. That is useful information for portfolio and trade planning if we can make estimates about the sectors most likely to surprise to the downside. As you can see in the following chart, WTI oil futures have recently completed an   pattern that today's decline is threatening to invalidate. In my opinion, the pattern is still intact if the price can break back above the   of the pattern without forming a new short-term low. I expect that we will continue to see some news about the U.S./China trade negotiations this week that could increase  . Additionally, traders will be watching   Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday and Wednesday as he provides testimony and answers questions in both houses of Congress. Today's somewhat outsized move in income sectors indicates that investors are nervous about the outlook for interest rates and will be seeking confirmation that Powell's Fed does not plan to raise rates again in the short term.

Metals have received much attention in recent days due to factors such as the announcement that Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX) is launching a hostile bid for Newmont Mining Corporation ( ). Given the news along with the rising prices of all metals over the past several weeks, it could be an interesting time to take a closer look at the charts to determine why recent price action could be signaling the beginning of a much stronger run higher. Most attention when it comes to the metals segment of the   market goes to gold. As one of the most popular   to market volatility and inflation, gold tends to perform well when investors get nervous about the future. With the increased activity in the M&A market within the precious metals area, investors are starting to pay closer attention because it could be a leading indicator of a continued move higher. Followers of technical analysis will often look to exchange-traded products such as the SPDR Gold Shares ( ) for insight into the future direction of the market. As you'll find below, the price of gold has been trading within a confined range shown by the two dotted  . Active traders will likely use these guides to determine the placement of their buy and stop orders. Furthermore, the recent crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving average, known as the  , is often used to signal the beginning of a long-term uptrend. Given the occurrence of this popular buy sign, it wouldn't be surprising to see traders ready themselves for adding to their position in a pullback. As the rarest of the precious metals, platinum often appeals to active traders as the purest way to trade increased attention in metals. Based on the chart of the ETFS Physical Platinum Shares ( ), the most common ETF used as a barometer for tracking the price of physical platinum, you can see that the price recently broke above the combined   of two trendlines and its 200-day moving average. This extremely strong reaction to key technical levels suggests that the bulls are in control of the momentum and that prices could be poised for a significant run higher. Some active traders will likely set their target prices near the 2018 highs around $95. Base metals are also gaining attention as the price of the Invesco DB Base Metals Fund ( ) – a common fund used to track a basket of copper, zinc and aluminum – has recently closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 2018. As described above, the bullish price action suggests that momentum is now in the control of the bulls and that prices could be headed toward $17.60, which is equal to the entry point plus the height of the pattern. Metals are in the spotlight for many followers of technical analysis. Bullish price action, nearby support and clearly defined risk/reward setups make this one segment of the commodities market that looks poised for strong growth over the coming weeks or months.

Twice a year, the chair of the Federal Reserve makes his or her way to Capitol Hill to deliver the Monetary Policy Report to Congress. Today, Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee. Tomorrow, he will testify before the  . During his remarks today, Powell surprised nobody by confirming the central bank's decision to stop raising interest rates. Regarding the  , Powell stated, "With our policy rate in the range of neutral, with muted inflation pressures and with some of the downside risks we've talked about, this is a good time to be patient and watch and wait and see how the situation evolves." In other words, the Fed can't justify raising interest rates to combat   because inflation doesn't appear to be a problem right now, and it can't risk hampering the U.S. economy by raising rates because there are too many risks – from trade and political uncertainties to slowing global economic growth. Regarding the  , Chair Powell explained, "We will continue to use our administered rates to control the policy rate, with an ample supply of reserves so that active management of reserves is not required. Having made this decision, the Committee can now evaluate the appropriate timing and approach for the end of balance sheet runoff." Reading the tea leaves here, analysts seem to believe this means that the Fed is going to be less aggressive in winding down its balance sheet, which should help support the U.S. Treasury market and the   market. This is exactly what Wall Street expected to hear today. That's not to say Wall Street isn't excited about what it heard in Powell's testimony. Traders are thrilled that the Fed is planning on holding off on raising rates and keeping a hefty portion of its massive balance sheet. But traders had already priced this news into their positions. When rumors and assumptions have been priced in beforehand, not much happens once the official news is released. You can see this with the reaction of the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX). It dropped a little on the confirmation that the Fed will be buying more Treasuries in the future to maintain its Treasury holdings on its balance sheet, but the TNX stayed well within the   range it has been in since late January. Based on the converging downtrending   and the uptrending  , it doesn't look like this consolidation range is going to last much longer before the TNX breaks out, but that breakout did not happen today because Chair Powell failed to deliver an unexpected catalyst. Just as bond traders felt no need to take dramatic action in the Treasury market, stock traders felt no need to change the status quo in the equities market in the aftermath of Chair Powell's testimony. The S&P 500 opened slightly lower from its close price yesterday, bounced ever so slightly during mid-day trading and then pulled back down to close almost exactly where it opened. While this lackluster movement failed to break the index up through resistance, it also did little to suggest that the bullish uptrend the S&P 500 has been enjoying all year is at risk of coming to a close. The S&P 500 is still within striking distance of breaking through the 2,816.94 resistance level the index set on Oct. 17, 2018, and may only need a small positive surprise to push up to new 2019 highs. The British pound (GBP) has been struggling since April 2018 as currency traders have wondered what the fate of the British economy might be if its planned   from the European Union doesn't go well. With the March 29 exit deadline fast approaching and no trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union in place, you would think currency traders would be panicking and selling the GBP. But you would be wrong. They are doing the exact opposite. The   spiked higher today, completing an   bullish reversal pattern as the GBP gained strength and the U.S. dollar (USD) weakened in reaction to Chair Powell's congressional testimony. Currencies tend to lose strength when their associated central bank signals that it is going to pursue a more accommodative monetary policy. The currency pair has come a long way from its 52-week low of 1.2373 USD per GBP on Jan. 3. It has rebounded 14% during the past two months to close today at 1.3254. This tells us that, while there are uncertainties and risks swirling around the Brexit discussion, currency traders believe that too much risk has been priced in to the market. Watch for these currency traders to continue climbing the wall of worry throughout March. Surviving on Wall Street is about understanding and appropriately reacting to expectations. When expectations are met, not much has to be done to adjust your portfolio. However, when expectations are not met – either to the upside or the downside – adjustments need to be made.

As I mentioned in yesterday's Chart Advisor newsletter, the British pound (GBP) has been surprisingly defensive lately. From a technical perspective, the   exchange rate was forming a bullish   pattern, which was completed today. That pattern is surprising because of all the uncertainty Brexit is causing – it seems investors have already priced Brexit into the market. As you can see in the following chart, the technical pattern I pointed out yesterday has completed a breakout with a provisional price target of 1.3685 based on a   of the pattern itself. This method is reasonable at estimating breakout targets; however, in this case, the unknowns around Brexit could make this more of a guess than an estimate. The bullishness in the GBP is the result of news that the European Union may insist on a delay of two years or more if an agreement can't be reached. This announcement reduces the risk for a very "hard" or "no deal" Brexit where there is no agreement in place when the U.K. leaves the EU. As major components of the global economy, both sides of Brexit would benefit from a smoother transition out of the EU (or even an increased potential for the U.K. remaining in the union). This is also a positive for U.S. stocks, which would otherwise suffer if growth in Europe and the U.K. were to decline further. Unfortunately, the Brexit news did not help the S&P 500 make progress against   at 2,800 today. Investors may have been distracted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to the House Financial Services Committee or President Trump's former attorney's testimony to the House Oversight Committee. The potential for anything earthshaking to emerge from either event was unlikely, but there weren't any other positive catalysts for a breakout today either. With all the political news soaking up the headlines today, another issue facing the markets is heating up without very much coverage. Pakistan says it has shot down two Indian pilots over the disputed region of Kashmir after India had launched airstrikes on Pakistani territory yesterday. While this doesn't guarantee war between the two nuclear powers, it is a significant escalation of hostilities. It should go without saying that the potential for armed conflict is almost always a source of risk for the markets. However, traders have been surprisingly sanguine about the news. Indian stocks like Infosys Limited ( ), Tata Motors, Limited ( ) and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Limited ( ) were a little mixed but didn't show any signs of panic selling or hedging. Hopefully, the conflict will be cooled before more lives are lost, and this week's events won't have a lasting impact on the markets. However, keeping an eye on asset classes that move the most when investors fear an escalation may provide some advance notice for stock traders. In my experience, gold and the Swiss franc (CHF) are the easiest   assets to track, and both rise in value quickly when investors start to discount or hedge against global risk events like the Pakistan/India conflict. Both assets retreated today, which is a good sign. If you don't have access to   or futures charts for the CHF or gold, you can use ETFs that hold those assets as a substitute. For example, in the following chart, I have plotted the SPDR Gold Trust ( ) and the CurrencyShares Swiss Franc ETF ( ). As you can see, both funds retreated today as investors evaluated the risks of the incidents over the past two days. However, if both safe-haven assets start to rise dramatically, investors should be careful about their long-stock positions as well. Besides the unexpected news of conflict between India and Pakistan, this week's schedule hasn't produced many surprises. Powell's testimony didn't contribute much to market volatility, and investors seem to be encouraged by the Brexit news. The last major remaining news event for this week is an advance   report for the fourth quarter that will be out before the market opens on Thursday. In my opinion, although resistance on the S&P 500 has been holding at 2,800, the risk of any major declines is continuing to recede.

Jitters over India's upcoming election have seen Indian stocks sputter into 2019 with the country's benchmark S&P BSE   Index down 0.90% year to date (YTD), while the nation's large-cap index, the NSE Nifty 50, is off 1.11% for the year as of Feb. 21, 2019. Over the same period, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ( ), an   that tracks emerging markets, has returned nearly 9% YTD. Although polls suggest that incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to be re-elected in the April and May general elections,  , investors appear hesitant to commit to Indian stocks. In addition to election uncertainty, investors are also trying to digest a surprise interest rate cut earlier this month by the Reserve Bank of India and debt concerns looming over conglomerate companies IL&FS Transportation Networks Limited (IL&FSTRANS.NS) and Essel Group. Despite the indecision, some analysts believe that the elections won't impede India's growth. "The elections can only boost or dampen sentiment depending on the news flow, but they won't massively impact the underlying earnings and economic growth of the country," said Anand Radhakrishnan, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Asset Management India,  . Indian ETFs rallied from technical   in Wednesday's trading session, indicating a return of buying interest in anticipation of a likely Modi victory. Traders can gain exposure to Indian stocks using these three ETFs. Let's explore several   ideas. Created in 2012, the iShares MSCI India ETF ( ) aims to track the investment results of the MSCI India Index, which covers the top 85% of firms across the Indian securities market. The fund tilts exposure toward the financials and technology sectors, with respective allocations of 23.25% and 17.22%. A razor-thin average   of 0.03% and daily share volume of over 4.5 million shares makes this product ideal for short-term tactical traders. Trading at $32.07 with   (AUM) of $4.64 billion and offering a   of nearly 1%, the ETF is down 5.07% YTD as of Feb. 21, 2019. INDA charges a management fee of 0.68%, slightly below the 0.75% industry average. After recovering somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2018, INDA's share price has resumed its bearish action in early 2019. Despite the lackluster start to the year, a rare three-bar Japanese candlestick chart pattern known as a " " has formed on an uptrend line that extends back to late October, which raises the probability of an upside reversal. Traders who take a long position should book profits between $33 and $33.50, where the price may find   from the 200-day   (SMA) and a horizontal line. Consider placing a   beneath the second candle's low in the three-bar pattern. With net assets of more than $85 million, the Direxion Daily MSCI India Bull 3x ETF ( ) seeks to provide three times the daily return of the MSCI India Index, effectively making it a   version of the first fund discussed. An average spread of 0.31% makes the fund more suited to swing traders who can   to cover the higher trading costs. Getting in and out of positions shouldn't be an issue given the ETF's average   of $2.58 million. As of Feb. 21, 2019, INDL has a YTD return of -38.49% and pays a 0.19% dividend yield. INDL's share price rallied 46% between late October and late December last year as buyers looked to emerging markets for new opportunities. Since that time, buying interest has waned, with money flooding back into other emerging markets and U.S.   on hopes of a   between the United States and China. The ETF caught a bid in Wednesday's trading session, jumping almost 4% off a four-month trendline. Those who buy at the current price should consider setting a profit target at $70 resistance with a protective stop positioned under this month's low at $55.43, offering traders a healthy risk/reward ratio of over 1:3.5. Launched back in 2008, the WisdomTree India Earnings ETF ( ) attempts to provide similar returns to the WisdomTree India Earnings Index. The fund selects companies using a fundamental approach based on earnings in the prior fiscal year, adjusted for the availability of Indian stocks to foreign ownership. It concentrates sector exposure toward financials (23.78%), energy (18.64%) and technology (15.53%). Deep liquidity and a tight 0.04% average spread more than make up for EPI's pricey 0.84%  , especially for short-term traders. The ETF, with AUM of $1.36 billion and yielding 1.22%, is down 6.77% YTD as of Feb. 21, 2019. In line with the other India ETF charts above, EPI's price has failed to attract buying interest so far this year. In saying that, the   returned in force yesterday, pushing the fund up 1.38% on its heaviest volume since July 2018, with over 6 million shares changing hands. Swing traders who take a position here should bank profits on a move up to the $25 level, where the price may   around the December  . If the fund reverses course and falls below the trendline stretching back to late October, it would be wise to close out any open trades, as this invalidates the setup.

Economic announcements are tricky. You see, they have one glaring problem they will never be able to overcome – they only look into the past. While this may seem like an incredibly obvious statement, it's true. Economic announcements – no matter how much they can tell us about what happened during the past month, quarter or year – can't predict the future. This is an issue because traders are always trying to peer into the future to see if they can determine what is going to happen, and then they act accordingly. If they see bullishness on the horizon, they buy stocks. If they see bearishness, they sell. We saw a great example of this today when the   (NAR) released its   numbers. For the first time since 2015, the annualized home sales numbers dipped below 5 million – coming in at 4.94 million in January. At first blush, this would seem like negative news. And on its own, it would have been. However, traders were looking at something else. Declining Existing Home Sales numbers have been exacerbated by high mortgage rates. The higher mortgage rates are, the more expensive buying a home becomes, and home sales numbers suffer. During the past few months, mortgage rates have been declining because   have been falling. This trend of declining Treasury yields and mortgage rates has traders convinced that homes will become more affordable and that home buying will pick back up in Q1 2019. This belief in a bullish recovery spurred traders in to buying residential construction stocks like Lennar Corporation ( ), D.R. Horton, Inc. ( ), PulteGroup, Inc. ( ) and Toll Brothers, Inc. ( ) today after these stock had initially gapped lower at the opening bell. Each one of these stocks continued the uptrend it has been in during 2019 and closed higher for the day. We'll have to see if the trend of falling yields (read more about Treasury yields below) continues long enough to keep pushing residential construction stocks higher, but it was enough of a factor today to push these stocks into positive territory when most of the S&P 500 components were pulling back a bit. The S&P 500 took a break from closing at new highs today. This normally wouldn't be much to pay attention to, as the size of the pullback is so small. However, this pullback has caught my attention because the index has also formed a slight bearish   with the  .  A bearish divergence forms when an index or stock forms a higher high while the indicator forms a corresponding lower high. In this case, the S&P 500 formed a high of 2,738.98 on Feb. 5 and then formed a higher high of 2,789.88 yesterday on Feb. 20. This higher high was confirmed by today's pullback in the S&P 500. The stochastics indicator formed a high of 97.8 on Feb. 6 and then formed a lower high of 96.62 yesterday on Feb. 20th. The lower high was confirmed by the bearish crossing of the %K line below the %D line on the stochastics indicator today. Just because we are seeing this bearish divergence today does not guarantee that the S&P 500 is going to start moving lower. It does tell us momentum may be fading and that we should watch for a potential pullback. After dipping briefly below 3%, the 30-year Treasury Yield (TYX) has jumped back up to 3.05% and has completed a bullish   in the process. The TYX hit a multi-month low of 2.9% on Jan. 3. After an initial bounce higher, the indicator started stabilizing in a downtrending channel that held firm for more than a month. Today's bullish bounce caused the TYX to break up through the downtrending resistance level that formed the top of the channel, completing a broadening   bullish continuation pattern. This move may not be good for housing stocks, as rising long-term Treasury yields tend to push mortgage rates higher, but it is a good sign for bond investors and for those analysts who are looking for confirmation that traders are becoming increasingly confident in the strength of the U.S. economy. Long-term Treasury yields typically rise when traders anticipate economic growth and start to demand higher yields to compensate them for the time risk they are exposed to by buying Treasuries. We saw a few red flags today with the lower-than-expected Existing Homes Sales number from the NAR and the stochastics divergence on the S&P 500. However, I would consider those red flags to be tiny red flags based on the reaction we saw from Wall Street today. Sure, we need to pay attention to them. They are red flags after all. But they appear to be tiny because traders didn't start running for the exits. Had traders started selling off residential construction stocks or abandoning their bullish positions on the S&P 500, I would be more concerned. But for now, I'm simply making note of the tiny red flags and watching to see if the rebound is just around the corner.

On Friday, we learned that the Chinese trade delegation will be extending its visit to Washington DC, which was interpreted as a sign that progress is being made toward a new U.S./China trade deal. The major stock indexes performed well, with technology and industrials leading the way. My optimism is growing that the industrial, technology and commodity sectors will continue to the upside as investors price in a greater likelihood that President Trump will refrain from applying a new round of   on U.S. businesses importing goods and products from China. Largely due to gains in the energy sector, broad commodity indexes have already confirmed bullish technical signals to the upside. For example, although there were some   today, the iShares S&P GSCI Commodity ETF ( ) has continued to break out of its confirmed  . The S&P 500 also continued to rise and ended its fourth consecutive week of gains at the close today. I am still a little concerned that the market is becoming overbought and is due for a  , but betting against the trend seems unwise without any changes in the underlying fundamentals. From a technical perspective, I suggest monitoring 2,800 on the S&P 500 for signs of  . With tariff talks continuing next week, I would not be surprised to see investors hedge in front of a potential breakdown in the talks. It wouldn't be out of the ordinary to see the index give up 50 points or more while traders wait for an agreement to be announced. I usually focus on market risk indicators when evaluating sentiment. However, today I want to focus on a trick I have recommended many times to investors looking for individual stocks that may have a bias to the downside. This technique can be handy for avoiding risky stocks or when looking for bearish opportunities. The average long-term   for large mature companies that have completed a major merger or acquisition is one of the worst (next to biotechnology) in the market. We saw an excellent example for why that is the case today with the collapse of The Kraft Heinz Company ( ). The issue is that   activity is frequently overvalued at the time the deal is completed. If you think about the individual roles on each side of the transaction, it should make sense why even the best-case scenario is a zero-sum return for a business combination between large mature companies. Imagine that you are in charge of Company-A that wishes to acquire Company-T, which has a current   of $1 million. You wish to do this because you believe that combining A and T would generate $1.3 million in value. Now switch places and assume that you are in charge of Company-T and you have access to the same kinds of information that Company-A has. You should know that your firm is worth $1.3 million to Company-A as well. Investors rarely ask why Company-T should be willing to sell itself to Company-A for less than what it knows it is worth? If we assume that A's and T's management teams are both rational agents, then we have to assume that there is no excess value available from the merger because Company-T's shareholders will insist on being paid the full value for the firm. This problem has played out out over and over again, and the market's reaction to Kraft Heinz's   of $15.4 billion of its assets today is another good example. The Kraft Heinz merger was in large part sold to investors as a way to save on costs – which was accomplished to some extent but at the sacrifice of actually managing the combined behemoth while the retail food market changed. Experienced investors often use M&A activity as a sign that the market itself is strong because these deals are so often doomed and incredibly risky. Everything has to go right in order for them to work out well for shareholders, so increased M&A activity is considered a sign that managers are willing to take risks (even if ill-considered). My recommendation is to use M&A activity as a way to build a watch list of risky stocks either for bearish speculation when the market is weak, or just to avoid because they have a historically disproportionate risk/reward profile after the merger.   In addition to trade talks, next week should be interesting from an economic perspective.   numbers will be released on Tuesday, which could create some volatility if the numbers dip like retail sales did last Wednesday. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will also be testifying to both houses of congress next Tuesday and Wednesday, which I expect will be closely watched for signs that he is more concerned about growth than the committee has already revealed in the FOMC minutes. Finally, advance   numbers for the first quarter will be released on Thursday, which includes new inflation data. It will be a good week to stay flexible and focus on risk control.

If you ever thought, "I never thought I would read a comparison between pirates and the financial markets," just think about this: Somali pirates actually set up an exchange, much like a stock market, to finance operations. That's right – at one time, you could invest in your favorite modern pirates and participate in the success of the venture. Mohammed (a wealthy former pirate) told a Reuters reporter as he took him on a tour, "The shares are open to all and everybody can take part, whether personally at sea or on land by providing cash, weapons or useful materials ... we've made piracy a community activity." What happy thought: organized exchange-traded pirates! Crazy as that is, it helps highlight this one key point – opportunity exists all over the place. Just because the news beats the bear drum, it doesn't mean there's not opportunity. Look at last fall and winter as an example. The rally from lows has been astonishing to say the least. Let's have a look here: My key takeaway is this: growth has been leading us out of the ashes. That's a great thing regardless of the reason. By that, I mean, whether growth was unfairly punished heading into the fall of last year, if investors fled for fear or if consensus was saying that growth would grind to a halt – whatever the reason – it seems that those arguments were either wrong or have now been largely discounted to zero. The small caps are king now. The U.S. dollar is hurting other currencies, and Europe is facing its fair share of problems.   looms over an already worsening situation there. The flight from that landscape to U.S. small caps is clearly evident. The   has rallied more than 25% from Dec. 24 lows. The Russell 2000 Growth Index is up nearly 28% over the same time. The S&P Small Cap 600 Index is up 24.3% since Christmas. The value indexes are lagging, while the growth indexes are charging ahead. As far as sectors go, we see a similar story – the four strongest sectors have been industrials, information technology, consumer discretionary and energy. There is a lot of growth embedded in these sectors. Safe sectors such as utilities, communications, staples and real estate have lagged their better-performing peers. With that said, their performance has been excellent nonetheless. So when we think back to the headlines swirling around the end of last year, with all the big scary bears, how could they all have gotten it so wrong? Well, one interview I did recently pointed out that bear markets fall in stages, and the worst may be yet to come. But I beg to differ. There are countless examples of companies bucking the trend. Could it be just a technical rally sparking us into   territory? I concede that this is a possibility – yet, while we are overbought, we have rallied for an excellent reason. Sales and earnings are largely working. According to FactSet Earnings Insight, as of Feb. 15, 2019: The Street generally went and revised its expectations downward to prepare for the pending growth doom. Analysts did not want to be caught flatfooted when the world slowed down, and they had already issued rosy sales and earnings outlooks. Well guess what – they were wrong and are often caught flatfooted the other way! Can't win! Here's a great example: The Trade Desk, Inc. ( ). This is a company that has been on our radar for a long time – you should know it well by now. Last night, The Trade Desk came out and absolutely smashed earnings estimates: This is what the chart looks like today, up +30%! Naturally, our whole focus here is to identify names like this beforehand by trying to find unusual   buying signals, represented by the green bars here: But for those who hate self-back-patting, what's important here is that growth is alive and well and attracting capital. The story here is that the market is fighting back with a vengeance, and equities are looking strong. We believe that we are entering a more selective narrow bull market in terms of opportunities, but the names are still out there. As far as getting the market right in terms of bull or bear, remember Elbert Hubbard, who said, "Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out alive." We (Mapsignals) continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, but we see a risk of a near-term giveback if institutional selling increases. Selling has been non-existent so far this year. We see the year-to-date lift in stocks as very constructive. As growth stocks gain on increasing volumes, we believe that earnings season could be better than overall expectations.

While Wall Street seems to be largely shrugging off concerns about trade tariffs and the back-and-forth trade war rhetoric between the United States and China, not all sectors have escaped unscathed. The   has been hit especially hard. The tariffs that have already been put in place between the United States and China have reduced trade between these two economic giants. Plus, traders are concerned about the potential of a global economic slowdown. Both factors have been a drag on raw materials producers as demand for   has slackened – especially from China, which historically has been an enormous commodity consumer. You can see this drag in the performance of the materials sector during 2019 compared with every other sector in the market. I've used SPDR sector-based   (ETFs) to illustrate this in the chart below. The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ) is up only 5.85% this year, while the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ) has grown by an impressive 15.37%. Watch for this trend of underperformance to persist as the Trump administration continues to negotiate with its Chinese counterparts. The S&P 500 took a break from closing at new highs today, but it is still showing signs of strength as the   indicator remains firmly in overbought territory. New traders often make the mistake of believing that seeing an  , like the stochastics, in an overbought position – which is any time the stochastics rises above 80 – means that the index has moved up as high as it can go and is ready to turn around. However, oscillating indicators can remain overbought for extended periods of time. For instance, it's a sign of strength for the trend when the stochastic   above 80. Only when the stochastics drop back below 80 after having been above that level should traders start to worry about a reversal of momentum. Knowing this, I wouldn't be surprised to see the S&P 500 continued drifting higher next week – even if the market does experience a little profit taking on Friday heading into the long three-day weekend. Market   come in a variety of formats. Some give shorter-term outlooks, while others give longer-term outlooks, but they all provide insight into the health of the market as a whole. One of my favorite market breadth indicators is the S&P 500 Stocks Above Their 200-Day Simple Moving Average. The name of the indicator is pretty self explanatory – it shows the percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 that are trading above, or at, their respective 200-day   (SMAs). I like this indicator for a variety of reasons. First, there is no ambiguity in the indicator. A stock either is, or is not, trading above its 200-day SMA. Second, it provides a longer-term trend outlook. The 200-day SMA is the industry standard for assessing the long-term trend of a stock. Typically, when a stock is trading above its 200-day SMA, it indicates that the stock is enjoying longer-term bullish momentum. Conversely, when a stock is trading below its 200-day SMA, it indicates that the stock is enduring longer-term bearish momentum. Focusing on longer-term trend helps eliminate a lot of the noise that bombards the market on a daily basis. Third, the indicator looks at a broad range of stocks. By covering the entire S&P 500, it gives you insight into every sector of the stock market instead of narrowly focusing on one or two sectors. So what's happening with the S&P 500 Stocks Above Their 200-Day Simple Moving Average indicator right now? The indicator broke above 50% this week for the first time since October 2018. This is big news because it shows at least half of the S&P 500 components are experiencing enough bullish momentum during this recovery to push them back above their 200-day SMAs. When you compare that to the woeful state of affairs on Christmas Eve 2018 when less than 10% of S&P 500 components were trading above their 200-day SMAs, you can appreciate just how dramatic this bullish turnaround has been. Of course, it is important to remember that the 200-day SMAs for these stocks have likely dropped to much lower levels than they were at during September 2018 when the S&P 500 reached its all-time high, but seeing this confirmation of renewed, broad-based bullish enthusiasm on Wall Street is a good indicator that the market in general is healthy. We don't need to worry that the index is only being driven higher by a few key components while the rest of the stocks are languishing. While the stock market continues to show multiple signs of strength, Wall Street is also indicating it has realistic expectations for the future. This is a healthy sign for the market. Enthusiasm is good, but too much enthusiasm could spook traders and burn up any available bullish fuel too quickly.

They say it's better to be lucky than smart. On July 28, 1945, a B-25 bomber crashed into New York City's Empire State Building. Betty Lou Oliver was the elevator operator on the 80th floor. When the plane hit a floor below, Oliver got burned severely and needed immediate medical attention. Rescuers put her in the elevator, but the cables snapped and sent Betty Lou plummeting 75 floors to the basement of the building. Somehow, Ms. Oliver survived and holds a Guinness World Record for the longest survived elevator fall. She was back to work five months later. She survived the same fall that killed King Kong. In a less life-threatening way, you could also consider yourself a lucky one if you hadn't sold out of desperation late last year. I recently saw a few headlines that Asian markets were down on renewed fears of a slowing U.S. economy and global trade. It's almost like there is a bin of "excuses" that gets recycled every now and then to try and attract fear-based clicks. The fact is, we are nearly eight weeks from lows, and we had yet another week of strength as   broadly rallied for another solid showing. Growth is clearly coming back in the main indexes. The   and   are the biggest winners, with the broader-based   and industrials-focused   "lagging." I put   in quotes because an eight-week +18% performance in any broad-based index is usually not associated with the word   But lag they do, well behind the engines of growth. Small caps are leading again, with the Russell 2000 posting a 4.17% gain last week. Look at the one-week return of the Russell 2000 Growth at 4.82%. The S&P Small Cap 600 also posted a huge 4.35% gain. So, growth appears alive and well after all, blossoming from its drubbing last year. Growth was the whipping boy for those releasing their anxiety over a market "gone up too fast" and "global growth faltering will take us all down." Those headlines worked from August to December 2018. I must give the news outlets credit for trying. Sectors to pay attention to have been energy, industrials, consumer discretionary and info tech. Again, these are growth-laden sectors for the most part and not the safe harbors for bears seeking   plays. In fact, some of the defensive sectors are lagging. The utilities sector is up   7.64% from Christmas lows and was the only sector to show a negative performance through Thursday last week. It's crazy to say this, but health care is the second worst performing sector since Christmas with a +14.93% screamer. What crazy times we live in. Unprecedented selling met with unprecedented buying is where we are at. I remember having the conversations right around Dec. 24, when I was told, "This time feels different – I don't see a   from this depth. I'd be surprised if that happens." After two decades working in the financial markets, I have come to find that the one thing there is really no room for is "surprise." The market is going to do what it is going to do, and the best thing to do to orient yourself is read the data that the market gives you. December said that we were  , and our data said that we would rally. Now our data says we are  , but we can stay that way for a long while. Our signals have a time range component in them; that is, we look at a roughly three-month high and low to determine a shift or continuation of near-term trends. A three-month high is way easier to violate right now than a three-month low. In my opinion, what this means is that more time must pass – at least another four weeks – for us to start getting significant  . So where do I stand? I continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term. In the near term, I am expecting a giveback, but again, we can stay on bullish momentum for quite a while. The   on big investors needing to deploy capital started the snowball rolling for a melt-up. It has pushed right into February, and we have further wind at our backs: earnings. Sales and earnings are largely working, and we are seeing many surprises. According to FactSet Earnings Insight: More than 70% of companies are beating earnings estimates, and more than 60% are beating sales expectations. Earnings are still growing, with five straight quarters of double-digit growth and six sectors revised upwards from Dec. 31. Negative guidance means that companies are pricing in more realistic impacts of possible slowing growth. The P/E ratio for the S&P is reasonably below the five-year average. These are not weak stats by any means. It would have been very unlucky to have sold at 2018 lows. The lucky ones held on and are more or less right back to where they were. As Tolstoy said, "The two most powerful warriors are patience and time." Mapsignals continues to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, but we see a risk of a near-term giveback. We see the year-to-date lift in stocks as very constructive. As growth stocks gain on increasing  , we believe that earnings season could be better than overall expectations.

Walmart Inc. ( ) surprised traders – who have become increasingly skeptical about the health of the retail industry – this morning with a better-than-expected earnings announcement. The company announced revenue that was in line with estimates and beat non-GAAP earnings estimates by $0.08 per share – coming in at $138.79 billion and $1.41 per share, respectively. While the earnings per share beat was a positive for the stock, the real bullish surprises came when Walmart announced that its   had grown by 4.2% during Q4, beating analyst estimates of 3.3%, and its online sales had increased by 21% year over year. Throw in a 1.9% dividend increase – raising the annual dividend from $2.08 to $2.12 – and you have the recipe for a huge gap higher at the opening bell. This bullish move confirmed the   bullish reversal pattern that was completed yesterday. Based on the $13 height of the bullish pattern, Walmart has a potential price target of $112 ($99 breakout point + $13 pattern height = $112 price target). Unfortunately for all of the Walmart bulls out there, the stock couldn't hold onto all of its gains. While shares jumped as high as $104.18 today, Walmart stock slid all the way back down to close just $0.13 above its low of $102.07 for the day. This late-day profit taking kept Walmart below the downtrending resistance level that has been interacting with the stock since early 2018, when it reached its recent high of $109.98. The stock hit this level again in early November 2018 at a high of $106.21 before collapsing with the rest of the bearish market. Coupled with the uptrending support level that has been interacting with the stock since October 2017, the downtrending resistance level is forming a potential long-term   price pattern. If Walmart can break above the downtrending resistance level, the stock could be signaling the renewal of a long-term uptrend, but it's going to have to get past the profit takers first. The S&P 500 continued its relentless move higher today, and while it still has farther to go before it reaches its all-time high, it is providing plenty of technical signals to confirm that its bullish momentum is still strong. A few days ago, the S&P 500 crossed above its 200-day   (SMA). I noted last week how more than 50% of the S&P 500 component stocks have risen above their respective 200-day SMAs and what a strong market breadth signal that was. Now the S&P 500 itself has done the same thing. The farther the S&P 500 pulls away from its 200-day SMA, the more likely it is to remain above it in the near term. The S&P 500 is also still climbing its upper  . It retreated slightly from the band in early February but is now showing renewed strength as it rides the band higher. Many traders mistakenly believe that hitting the upper Bollinger Band® during an uptrend can serve as resistance, but it actually confirms the strength of the current trend and signals that there may be more bullishness to come. ' Gold spiked higher today as the value of the U.S. dollar slipped and traders renewed their efforts to hedge their portfolios with the safe-haven asset. You can see in the SPDR Gold Shares ETF ( ) chart below how gold has been increasing in value since the stock market topped out in late September 2018. Interestingly, that bullish trend has accelerated as   – illustrated by the blue 10-year Treasury line (TNX) in the chart below – have fallen and the stock market has moved back into bullish territory. This tells us a few things. First, gold is always more competitive when Treasury yields are lower because gold is a non-yielding asset – it doesn't pay a dividend or have a   associated with it. Second, traders appear to be trying to hedge some of the risk in their long-equity portfolios by adding gold to the mix. The bullish trend that is underway on Wall Street is strong, but traders are still showing signs of approaching the trend with caution. They are adding risk by buying stocks, but they are attempting to hedge a portion of that risk by buying safe-haven assets like gold. So long as this diversification continues to assuage traders' nerves in the short term, the S&P 500 has a great chance of climbing back up to its early-November highs in the near term.

Latin America refers to the group of countries that comprise the central to southernmost parts of the Western hemisphere. The  , diverse populations and cultures, and an overall abundance of natural resources make the region of specific interest to investors looking to diversify their portfolios outside of the major markets. In the paragraphs below, we'll examine the charts and try to determine how traders will be looking to position themselves over the weeks or months ahead. As the name suggests, the iShares Latin America 40 ETF ( ) provides investors with targeted exposure to Latin American stocks. More specifically, the fund comprises 41 holdings from across Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia. The fund is heavily geared toward the financial, energy and materials sectors with   of 40.95%, 15.13% and 14.66% respectively. Taking a look at the chart, you can see that the fund has been trading within a defined range over much of the past year. The recent break beyond the   of the upper trendline is a clear indication that the bulls are in control of the momentum. Based on this pattern, active traders will now likely be setting their target prices near $38, which is equal to the entry point plus the height of the pattern.   will likely be placed below either the 50-day or 200-day moving averages, depending on risk tolerance. With 62.57% of the ILF fund coming from Brazil, it wouldn't be surprising to see active traders focus their attention on this sector by adding a position in targeted funds such as the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF ( ). Taking a look at the chart, you can see that the price has recently broken out of a well-formed   pattern. This bullish chart pattern is a favorite among active traders because of the clear buy and sell signals that are generated from moves beyond the identified trendlines. In this case, the breakout above the handle following a bounce from its 200-day moving average was a clear signal that the bulls were readying for a sharp move higher. The recent close above the upper trendline and short period of   now suggest that the price is gearing up for the next leg higher. Stop losses will most likely be placed below $40.95 in case of a sudden shift in momentum. With the recent rise in the price of various metals such as copper, some active traders may want to take a look at investments in Chile or Peru given their significant expertise and exposure. As you can see from the chart of the iShares MSCI Chile Capped ETF ( ), the price has recently been able to move beyond its 200-day moving average, which is a common long-term level of resistance that highlights the direction of the underlying trend. If the pullback toward the newly formed   is able to hold, current levels would be an ideal spot to buy given the clearly defined risk-to-reward scenario. The region of Latin America hasn't really received much in the way of positive media attention in recent weeks. However, given the charts mentioned above, it appears as though active traders will be well suited to ignore the news stories and look at add some exposure to their portfolios by trading the patterns mentioned above.

President Trump indicated that he would be willing to let the March 1 deadline for more tariffs on Chinese imports slide a little if the progress continues on trade talks. Also, according to reporting by Bloomberg, the president will grudgingly sign the budget/border deal being hammered out in congress. While neither issue is a "done deal," traders will probably be willing to bid the major indexes higher on the news. The reaction to President Trump's comments on trade had a stronger effect on stocks in mainland China than in the U.S. I have recently pointed to the relative strength in the   Hong Kong index, but the   also broke out of a bullish double bottom pattern today. In the following chart, I have used a   based on the second low of the double bottom pattern to create an upside price target for the Shanghai Composite. However, from a best-practices perspective, it makes sense to treat that price level as tentative because the last two major signals on the index failed. Even though they weren't official announcements from the White House, the news about trade and a budget deal would have normally sent prices much higher. The open on the S&P 500 was initially very strong, but traders got the rug pulled out from beneath them following a report that Florida senator Marco Rubio is proposing a plan to tax share   like dividends. Whether buybacks are good or bad for stock performance and shareholders is debated. On the one hand, there are the outliers like Microsoft Corporation ( ) that have done very well during their buyback campaigns – however, are buybacks the source of the gains, or is it the growth in  ? A classic example of buybacks becoming a distraction and a poor substitute for good management has been the results experienced by International Business Machines Corporation ( ) and General Electric Company ( ) over the past few years. Regardless of the debate about whether buybacks increase shareholder value or not, new taxes are usually seen as a short-term negative for stocks. In my opinion, the fact that the proposal is coming from a Republican senator has made investors take it much more seriously as something that may eventually come to fruition. As you can see in the following chart, although the S&P 500 passed trendline resistance yesterday, momentum evaporated following the announcement. I would be surprised if the major indexes didn't use the changes today as an excuse to "sell the news" and retest support. I believe the net impact of the news today will be supportive for higher stock prices in the short term. If Washington can create less uncertainty, I would expect earnings estimates for the first quarter to start to improve from where they are now. Besides meddling from the official sector, there are still two other areas where improvement could make a material difference for investor expectations. First, as I have mentioned several times in previous Chart Advisor issues, the dollar's recent strength will drag on corporate returns and worsen the trade deficit. Second, the   is still flat as a board – this yield curve behavior is correlated with a recession. A flat yield curve is a problem for the financial sector and capital investment because the returns on long-term loans and capital projects aren't high enough relative to the cost of short-term capital. One example of this problem is that, if banks are borrowing at short-term rates and lending at long-term rates, there isn't enough profit to justify taking risks on long-term loans. As you can see in the following chart, after flirting with turning negative in December, the difference between the interest rate on 10-year   and 2-year Treasury yields is still a fraction of what it was in 2014 and almost as low as it has been since the last recession. A positive yield curve not only is a sign of growth: it creates the opportunity for better performance by making it easier to profit from long-term loans and capital projects.   The retail sales report from the Census Bureau is due tomorrow and should help provide some guidance for the retail reports coming next week from firms like Walmart Inc. ( ). The flat   report released today doesn't suggest that consumption will be a huge surprise, but anything positive is still likely to help keep volatility low. Assuming we continue to see positive news about the budget and trade, I expect any dips in the major indexes to be brief.

Tuesday we posted a   and asked you all to let us know what you would do – buy, sell or do nothing? As we expected, there weren't any bearish responses. Instead, most of you were buyers at current levels or on a pullback. We believe that the evidence is clearly pointing in that direction too, which is why we put the question out there in the first place. What, if anything, could we be missing? Now that we're all on the same side of the boat, let's get into the chart and why we feel it's relevant. The chart we originally shared was an inverted daily line chart of the iShares MSCI Japan ETF ( ) relative to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( ). The corrected chart shows prices resolving a multi-year range to the downside in mid-2018, quickly meeting our first downside objective and then consolidating in a classical "bear flag" pattern. Its   has finally caught down, and prices are now resuming lower, with   quickly getting oversold again. This looks like a very clear chart, with all of the evidence suggesting that lower prices are ahead. From a risk management perspective, we can use our initial target of the 161.8% extension as our new risk management level, targeting the 261.8% extension over the intermediate to long term. Japan isn't the only developed market that's at or near new lows relative to the S&P 500. While some outliers have been able to buck that trend, when looking at the group as a whole, we see that these multi-year trends of underperformance are very strong, and there continues to be little evidence of them reversing any time soon. Calling tops and bottoms is not our thing, so instead, we'll use these new breakdowns to define our risk on the short side if executing these  , or we'll continue to use it as information to identify fund flows. Money flows to where it's treated best ... and most developed markets excluding the U.S. and Canada have not been kind to it for a very long time.

Many of the basic tenets of technical analysis can be traced back to " ," which was first developed by Charles Dow (of Dow Jones fame) in a series of editorials published in The Wall Street Journal. These ideas include the principles that the indexes discount the news and that market trends require confirmation. Specifically, Dow Theory considers a breakout in a broad index (like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500) confirmed if   have also broken to new highs. If you think about it, this should make sense: if large industrial firms are growing (especially during Dow's day), then the transportation companies that ship goods and commodities to and from the industrial firms should also be growing. If the indexes aren't confirming each other, the potential for a " " increases. New lows in the transportation index while the S&P 500 was continuing to rise in early 2015 was an important warning of the upcoming volatility that year. Although the dominance of the industrial sector has waned in the subsequent 120 years since Dow Theory was developed, I think transportation stocks still provide important confirmation for a strong bullish rally in the S&P 500. The U.S. economy is mostly driven today by personal consumption, but goods and services are still shipped and transported to consumers. At this point, neither the S&P 500 nor transportation indexes have broken to new highs, so we haven't experienced a confirmation signal like we did in November 2016 or January 2013 prior to those dramatic rallies. However, I think we can still use transportation stock performance to provide a heads-up as to when momentum is more likely to strengthen. Norfolk Southern Corporation ( ) gave an investor presentation today showing how the rail company would reduce its   to 60% by the year 2021 through a combination of technological efficiency, capital investment and cost reductions (reducing headcount). The operating ratio is the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses and is a standard measure for transportation company efficiency. Another way to think about this is that the railroad company is trying to increase its   (operating income/revenue) to 40%. Investors liked what Norfolk Southern's management had to say, and the announcement had a "halo effect" on other stocks in the industry. In fact, as you can see below, the S&P Road and Rail sector has closed at a new short-term high today. While this isn't fully representative of the entire transportation sector, it's a positive sign that investors are pricing in more growth opportunities in the market. Bullish momentum in a key sector like transportation is important while the S&P 500 continues to consolidate near its 61.8%   level. Part of the problem with the tariffs is that much of the increased costs are borne by consumers. Beginning next week, the pace of earnings reports from consumer stocks will increase significantly, which increases the risk that the outlook for first quarter earnings could be reduced again if the trade situation is expected to worsen. A continued rally in transportation stocks could do a lot to offset potential bad news in earnings. Although I have focused on this a lot over the past two weeks, the U.S. dollar's continued run to the upside is becoming a greater concern. The dollar index rallied again today against most of the majors in the  . The Invesco DB US Dollar Index ETF ( ) has now completed a short-term   pattern that has an upside target equal to the prior highs from last December. In previous issues of the Chart Advisor newsletter, I pointed out that a stronger dollar discounts the profits earned by U.S. multinationals, but there are other issues as well. A stronger dollar makes U.S. exports less competitive because they are more expensive in foreign currency terms. The inverse of that problem is that imports to the U.S. are less expensive in U.S. dollar terms because a stronger dollar can be exchanged for more of a weaker foreign currency. A stronger dollar stunts exports and stimulates import growth in the short term, which worsens the U.S.  . In my view, the recent data on the U.S. trade balance has the potential to complicate trade negotiations, even if China's trade policies are not completely to blame. The stronger the U.S. dollar becomes, the more challenging trade negotiations will be – that could send investors into another tailspin. Almost all risk indicators (besides the U.S. dollar) remain calm despite troubling headlines about trade with China. This leads me to conclude that volatility is still biased to the upside if the market starts to see good news on trade and earnings. However, compared to the rest of earnings season, this week is a little light on news until Thursday, when the Census Bureau releases   for the month. More aimless trading until Thursday (and potentially into next week) shouldn't be alarming, and many traders may be looking for   opportunities if there is some short-term volatility.

Long-dated   have rallied to   ahead of catalysts that could affect U.S. economic growth into the next decade. For starters, time is running out for the U.S. and China to cut a trade deal that relieves pressure on world equity markets. The Federal Reserve pause on interest rate hikes is intimately tied to these negotiations because a faster growth track is likely to generate higher  . A second government shutdown could also have an impact, dampening the trajectory of 2019 GDP. According to founder BlackRock, Inc. ( ), the   "seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities greater than 20 years." The instrument offers a reliable snapshot of long-term bond trends as well as levels that need to be watched to gauge demand. It works especially well with the CBOE 10-Year Treasury Yield Index (TNX) in measuring the ebb and flow in those important venues. The TLT bond fund entered a strong uptrend in February 2011, jumping off a trading floor in the upper $80s and breaking out in 2012 above the 2009 high at $123.15, posted during the darkest phase of the economic collapse. The trend advance topped out at $132.21 in August of that year and eased into a shallower trajectory, posting nominal new highs in February 2015 and July 2016. A decline into July 2015 established range support at $115 that found committed buyers during pullbacks in 2016, 2017 and the first half of 2018. It finally broke down in October 2018, generating a selling climax that reached a four-year low at $11.90, ahead of a bounce that remounted support in December. Price action since that time has lifted the fund into the 200-week   (EMA) and range resistance (upper red line), reinforced by four 2018 reversals. Long-dated Treasuries often trade against equity markets, but both groups are now in sync, coupled by the threat of slower growth and lower demand for capital. A breakout above resistance at $123 would ease bearish technicals in place since January 2018, but it could take a bona fide trade deal to attract needed firepower. Even so, it's a two-edged sword because stronger growth may affect long-term inflation expectations, generating higher   and lower prices. The   posted an all-time high in 1981, at the same time the Dow Jones Industrial Index entered a historic uptrend, and entered a downtrend that is now in its 38th year. Price action eased into a   in October 1987, with two trendlines limiting gains for the past 31 years. It hit a generational low near 14 in 2012 and tested that level in 2016, completing a potential   reversal. The index broke the red trendline in October 2017 and followed suit with the blue trendline in January 2018, signaling a multi-decade breakout that hasn't been confirmed in the past 13 months. However, it's still trading above both lines, while the monthly   has dropped into the most extreme oversold reading since 2010, predicting that 10-year yields will rise in the coming months. The 50-month EMA near 26 looks like major support on this massive chart, situated above both trendlines but below the January 2019 low. The 200-month EMA marks long-term resistance, as it has for the past three decades. Given this barrier, it will take a breakout into the mid-30s and 3.50% 10-year Treasury yield to confirm the double bottom reversal and proclaim the first bull market since the first year of the Reagan administration. Long-term technicals predict that the 10-year Treasury yield will rise in the coming months, putting pressure on 30-year bond prices. In turn, this suggests that the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF will have trouble gaining ground in 2019.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( ) is referred to as "Spiders" by active traders and investors. Spiders declined by 20.4% from its all-time intraday high of $293.94 set on Sept. 21 to its Dec. 26 low of $233.76, marking the bear market. The ETF closed Monday, Feb. 11, at $270.62, up 8.3% so far in 2019 and up 15.8% since trading as low as $233.76 on Dec. 26. This is a nice bear market rally, but with the ETF below a " ," it could be time to reduce holdings as Spiders tests its 200-day  , now at $274.08. The accelerating decline into the Dec. 26 low was fueled by forced selling, not panic selling. FINRA reported that   declined significantly in the fourth quarter. My eyeball estimate is that investors had to raise $50 billion to $60 billion in the fourth quarter to meet  . When Spiders traded as low as $233.76 on Dec. 26, the ETF turned on a dime. The main reason to buy on Dec. 26 was that the low was a test of the 200-week simple moving average, or " ," then at $234.71. This proved to be the correct call, as Dec. 26 was a classic "key reversal." Whenever a ticker sets a cycle low and then closes above the prior day's high, a tradeable rally follows. The Dec. 26 close of $246.18 was well above the Dec. 24 high of $240.83. My first target in 2019 was my semiannual risky level of $266.14, which became a magnet on Jan. 30 on the   commentary that followed the FOMC meeting that day. Since this date, most Fed watchers are debating as to what Fed policy is. I have been following the Federal Reserve since 1972, and here's my take. The Federal Reserve is using its   as its primary tool for monetary policy. The FOMC tightened monetary policy in January without raising rates. As of Feb. 6, the balance sheet was marked at $4.026 trillion, down $474 billion since the   of the balance sheet began in October 2017. The balance sheet totaled $4.5 trillion as the great unwind began. The total unwinding in January was $32 billion, assuming the $14 billion reduction was due to maturing Treasuries on Jan. 31. I believe that the Federal Reserve will keep the   at 2.25% to 2.50% as its revised "normal." The Fed balance sheet will become a primary monetary policy tool as the unwinding continues, but in the longer term, the Fed could increase the balance sheet without using   measures. The bear market decline began after Spiders set its all-time intraday high of $293.94 on Sept. 20, 2018. As the ETF declined, a "death cross" formed on Dec. 7, when the 50-day simple moving average declined below the 200-day simple moving average, indicating that lower prices would follow. This tracked the ETF to its Dec. 26 low of $233.76 and the "key reversal" day that confirmed a tradeable bear market rally. When under a "death cross," the strategy is to reduce holdings on strength to the 200-day SMA, now at $274.08. The close of $249.92 on Dec. 31 resulted in three horizontal lines. My semiannual pivot is $266.14, with my annual and quarterly risky levels at $285.86 and $292.16, respectively. The close of $269.93 on Jan. 31 resulted in the horizontal line at $277.88, which is my risky level for February. This week's value level is $260.22. The Spiders ETF popped above its semiannual pivot at $266.14 on Jan. 30 following the dovish news from the FOMC meeting. The weekly chart for Spiders has been positive since the week of Jan. 18, and the ETF is above its five-week modified moving average at $266.6. SPY is now well above its 200-week simple moving average, or "reversion to the mean," at $236.74 after this average held at $234.71 as a buying opportunity during the week of Dec. 28. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow   is projected to end this week rising to 67.41, up from 60.49 on Feb. 8. Now that you reduced holdings by booking profits at the 200-day simple moving average at $274.08, here's your updated strategy. Buy SPY on weakness to my semiannual pivot at $266.14 and to this week's value level at $260.22, and reduce holdings on strength to my monthly, annual and quarterly risky levels at $277.88, $285.86 and $292.16, respectively.

Traders on Wall Street are interesting creatures. Sometimes you never know what they are going to do, and sometimes they fall into rather predictable patterns. While it can be difficult to quantify, it often seems that intra-day trading patterns seem to develop more frequently than day-to-day patterns as traders try to adjust to fluctuations in the broader market. We're seeing one of those intra-day patterns emerging right now. Traders have been pushing the   higher during the last 30 minutes of trading for the past few weeks. This phenomenon has occurred on days when the S&P has closed higher for the day and on days when it has closed lower for the day. Historically, seeing traders buying into the closing bell is a sign of confidence in the days ahead. When traders are confident, they tend to add to their positions. When traders are nervous, they tend to trim their positions – especially heading into the uncertainty of overnight hours or the weekend. Seeing traders show enough confidence in the U.S. stock market to add to their portfolio during the final half hour of the trading each day is a good sign that the S&P 500's current bullish move still has plenty of momentum left. The S&P 500 broke up to new highs for 2019 on the heels of the news that Congressional leaders have reached a resolution to fund the federal government and avoid a shutdown and that negotiations between the United States and China seem to be progressing. Although neither announcement is a done deal, the removal of potential uncertainty from the market has been music to Wall Street's ears. Wall Street hates nothing more than uncertainty. After hitting downtrending   on Feb. 5 and Feb. 6, the S&P 500 successfully retested former resistance at 2,675.47 to see if it would hold as a new  . Now the S&P 500 has broken above 2,738.98 – the high from Feb. 5 – to establish yet another higher high in the dramatic uptrend the index has been in since bottoming out on Dec. 26, 2018. This move puts resistance at 2,820 within shooting distance. Projecting ahead a few months, if the S&P 500 climbs to 2,820 and then consolidates below this level for a while, it could eventually form a long-term   bullish reversal pattern. Of course, this is pure speculation at this point, but it is always helpful to visualize what might occur on your charts in the future so you can recognize the signals when they happen. The U.S. dollar (USD) has been getting consistently stronger since mid-February 2018. The USD first started to gain strength as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) signaled it was going to be consistently raising interest rates during 2018, which it did. The FOMC raised the   four times last year. Currencies tend to gain strength when their associated central bank raises short-term interest rates. Higher short-term interest rates tend to push longer-term yields higher, which makes investments in longer-term   more attractive. Typically, you are required to pay for government bonds in that country's currency, so foreign investors are forced to convert their currency into the local currency. This boosts demand for the local currency, which increases the value of that currency. With an increasing number of foreign investors drawn to U.S. Treasuries as the   (TNX) jumped as high as 3.25% in 2018, demand for the USD increased, and so did its value. However, the FOMC has pulled back from its interest rate hikes and has even signaled that it is going to slow the winding down of its balance sheet, keeping U.S. monetary policy more   than previously anticipated. This turnaround from the FOMC has sent the TNX back down below 2.7%, but the USD is still gaining strength. Government bond yields aren't the only driving force in the currency market. The strength of one economy compared to another can also drive currency value fluctuations. Currently, the USD is gaining strength against the euro (EUR) and the British pound (GBP) as   concerns and a slowing European economy make the USD look like a superior value. While this is good for forex traders who are long the USD, it's not so good for multi-national companies that generate a large portion of their profits overseas and repatriate them to the United States. When the USD is weaker compared to other currencies, multi-national companies make a better return on foreign-generated profits because of the exchange rate. For instance, if the exchange rate shows that €1 = $1.20, a company that generates €1 million in profit in Europe will book a profit of $1.2 million at home. Similarly, if the USD gets stronger and the exchange rate shows that €1 = $1, a company that generates €1 million in profit in Europe will book a profit of only $1 million at home. Nothing changes in the performance of the company, but its earnings decrease by $200,000 because of the change in the exchange rate. If the USD continues to strengthen, watch for the earnings growth expectations of large multi-national companies to be affected negatively. Not every stock that is part of the S&P 500 rose today, but most of them did. The heatmap of the index shows a sea of green, as every major sector saw strong growth. Seeing traders buy into the bullish move with both hands today gives us confidence that the bullish sentiment is here to stay for the rest of the quarter – barring any unforeseen surprises. The rising U.S. dollar could complicate earnings growth in future quarters, but Wall Street seems prepared to shrug that off for now.

Measuring unusual   activity has historically yielded prescient markers pinpointing short-term market local peaks. These triggers also provide opportunistic entry points for those on the sidelines who have been waiting for a pullback to participate in this multi-year bull market. This   signal is quite rare, and the last time it fired off was Jan. 24, 2018, and nearly two weeks later (Feb. 8, 2018) the Russell 2000 ETF ( ) fell 8.51%. I covered that overbought signal at the time in  . At Mapsignals, we measure potential unusual institutional activity on a daily basis and use these unusual buying/selling data points to plot a ratio. Over the years, we have found that there are peaks in this data set that coincide with local market peaks when the ratio skews heavily in favor of unusual trading activity ... likely buying. These periods tend to show extreme exuberance and often alert us to points where the market's velocity is unsustainable and due for a short-term  . These pullbacks are healthy and can provide a great entry point for those patiently waiting to get long equities. The latest overbought signal triggered the morning of Feb. 7, 2019, and based on history, we believe that the market could be near its local peak and that a pullback could be ahead, or the velocity of the recent rally could slow. We are long-term bullish on the market and believe that any meaningful pullbacks should be used as a buying opportunity. In the chart below, we define the ratio as a 25-day   of our buying/selling signals, overlaid with the Russell 2000. The ratio ranges between 0% and 100%. A reading approaching 25% (green) suggests an   market (in green), with selling signals heavily outweighing buying signals, and readings above 80% suggest an overbought market (in red), with buying signals heavily outweighing selling signals. Below is a look through recent history at prior times when we reached overbought (red). It does show that the average forward returns tend to be negative. But again, we are long-term bulls and use this ratio as an opportunity to pick up great stocks on a pullback. So, what does all of this mean? It basically just means that the level of buying relative to selling is extreme and there is a good chance that selling will pick up. As you can see in the chart above, the ratio tends not to stay in the red area for long. It's rare for unusual buying to reach current levels. Based on history, selling levels will begin to increase once our ratio falls out of the red area. This overbought signal has triggered, and we believe that the market's trajectory is due for a short-term pullback. Thus, we see a potential opportunity for patient investors to pick up shares at a lower level should the market pullback occur.

If you wanted to find an example of an industry that had been underperforming for years, the toys and games industry would have been a good place to look. One of the industry’s components, Mattel, Inc. ( ), hit its highest price point during the last   all the way back in 2013 and has been falling ever since. The drop has been so severe that Mattel stock actually fell to a lower price point in late December 2018 than it did following the 2008 financial crisis. However, Mattel got a temporary reprieve today in the aftermath of the company's earnings announcement after the closing bell on Thursday. Mattel beat revenue estimates by $80 million and earnings estimates by $0.23 per share – coming in at $1.52 billion and $0.04 per share, respectively. Traders reacted to the earnings beat and strong growth in Barbie and Hot Wheels sales during the holiday shopping season by sending the stock soaring up through long-term downtrending resistance in  . This move marks a confirmed breakout of the stock from the downtrending   it has been in. Of course, there are no guarantees that Mattel shares will continue to rally, but this breakout is the first step in what could be a new bullish uptrend. This is something we have been seeing a lot of this  : stocks that were either   or drifting lower have been breaking above resistance. It's no surprise that we're seeing this. Earnings announcements are often the catalysts for long-term trend changes. Traders are forced to instantaneously adjust to new information, and that new information can change analyst outlooks. In this case, one analyst at BMO Capital has raised his 12-month   for Mattel to $23 per share – a price the stock hasn't seen since June 1, 2017. The fact that Mattel pulled back from its intraday high just above $16 does signal that traders may not be willing to jump on board the long-term uptrend bandwagon just yet, but seeing the former downtrending resistance level holding up as support during this retest by the stock is encouraging. If Mattel stock can remain above $14.50, it has an excellent opportunity to continue climbing. The S&P 500 has pulled back from its downtrending resistance level during the past few trading days, but it is showing signs of resilience in the face of profit taking heading into the weekend. The index has managed to remain above 2,675.47 – the level that served as resistance while the S&P 500 was consolidating in late January but is now serving as support. Traders who are looking for confirmation that this bullish uptrend still has legs will be thrilled to see that the two sectors that provided the lion's share of the lift on Wall Street today were consumer goods – driven by Mattel, which soared 23.22%, and Mohawk Industries, Inc. ( ), which rose 5.91% – as well as technology – driven by Motorola Solutions, Inc. ( ), which jumped 14.12%, and Electronic Arts Inc. ( ), which climbed 16.05%.  Typically, strength in these two sectors is a sign of expected economic growth in the future and trader confidence on Wall Street. One of the best places to look outside of the stock market to confirm whether traders are confident or apprehensive about the future is the   market. Junk bonds are corporate bonds with a credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P) of BB or below, or a credit rating from Moody’s of Ba or below. The lower a company's credit rating, the more likely it is to   on its debt. When traders are confident in the future, they are more willing to put their money at risk by chasing after the higher   junk bonds offer. This pursuit of higher returns typically pushes the price of junk bonds higher as traders rotate money out of safer trades and into more aggressive positions. Conversely, when traders are less confident about the future, they are less willing to put their money at risk. This avoidance of high-risk trades typically pushes the price of junk bonds lower as traders sell their positions and move their money to more conservative investments. Looking at the chart of the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High-Yield Bond ETF ( ), you can see that traders have been moving money back into junk bonds since Dec. 26, 2018. While the most dramatic rise came during the first week of trading in 2019, junk bonds have continued to climb higher during the past month. This week's uptrending consolidation range signals that traders are still looking for more growth and an accommodative financial environment during the rest of Q1 2019. If traders were nervous about another bearish turnaround in the U.S. stock market, they would be bracing for the decline by offloading more of their junk bond positions. While there are certainly concerns on Wall Street that earnings growth is going to slow during Q1 2019 – potentially dropping into negative year-over-year growth territory – those concerns don't seem to have derailed trader enthusiasm. As long as companies continue to beat earnings expectations for Q4 2018 and traders continue to move into higher-risk assets, the S&P 500 is likely to remain stable.

The domino effect is something we're all familiar with. There are times when the domino effect can have some catastrophic consequences.  For example, take the curious case of the Cerise Mayo's Brooklyn bees in 2010. It was a wickedly hot summer and the first that allowed bee keeping in New York City. Cerise was a devoted beekeeper, raising her bees in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and giving them the best. But that summer, the normal amber bands on the bee bodies suddenly started turning bright red. The sight of late evening glowing red bees became an enchanting Brooklyn sight. Oddly enough, their honey was red too. This offbeat problem eventually pointed to the bees "hitting the juice" at Dell's Maraschino Cherries Factory. Someone obtained samples of bee secretions and found they were amped with red dye #40 – the same used in coloring the neon red cherries that sweeten countless Shirley Temples. Arthur Mondella, the factory's owner, hired Andrew Coté, the leader of the New York City Beekeepers Association, to help find a solution. Coté did, and that was that. But the bees at the maraschino factory attracted attention, and the DA decided to investigate environmental cases such as Mondella's. After crossing this odd story with a few complaints of marijuana odors near the factory, Dell's was on the hitlist. Investigators stormed into the factory a few years later to find the city's largest pot farm underneath the factory. When authorities came for Mr. Mondella, he barricaded himself in the bathroom and shot himself dead. In this ironic tragedy, a beekeeper named Cerise (French for cherry) kept red bees, in Red Hook Brooklyn, tainted by red dye from cherries, which led to a massive pot farm bust and the suicide of its owner. The same type of domino effect was witnessed in last year's market. We detailed this in our exhaustive look into why   (ETFs) caused the puke of 2018. Fear drove a lack of buying, creating a vacuum of  . Algo-traders seized the moment and spiked  . It got too hot to handle for ETF model managers, who hit the sell button. The outflows of ETFs were monstrous and led to massive pressure on stocks that were the components of ETFs. It all bottomed out on Dec. 24. Did someone now flip the dominoes the other way? We went from heavily   on Christmas Eve to   on Feb. 7. Leading up to Dec. 24, sellers were in so much control that it became unsustainable. Mapsignals called for a bounce, which came right on time. But now buyers took control, and in six short weeks, unusual buying has become unsustainable. The MAP (Mapsignals) Ratio oversold signal has been very accurate and timely. The MAP (Mapsignals) Ratio overbought signal has also been accurate, but less timely and less intense. Basically, we find that, throughout history, what goes down must come up, but what goes up may not have to come down – or at least not  In the Mapsignals white paper "Boundaries" published June of 2017 (found  ), we went into the expected forward market returns after overbought and oversold boundaries were pierced. As you can see from this excerpt below, the forward returns were very positive for oversold and negative for overbought. Either way, the overbought signal indicated that it is a time to consider  . We hit this rare signal again January 2018 and sent out a big update on Jan. 24. The market sank in a big way immediately after. So, when we hit it again Thursday morning (Feb. 7), as some of you may have seen, we shouted from the hilltops. The following is taken from the post that day and is essentially an updated version of the table above: Now, we have seen points in history when the market stays overbought for weeks, but it started sliding immediately after our update. They say it's better to be lucky than smart, but all this ratio really is saying is that lopsided buying is unsustainable and that the markets should expect some selling soon. It doesn't mean the market will tank – we just expect some giveback, and as of Friday mid-day, this was unfolding in real time. Let's look at what the market was up to last week: From Christmas Eve lows, the recovery has been massive. Small caps have led the rise, as seen in the Russell 2000, S&P Mid Cap 400 and S&P Small Cap 600 indexes. This is also reflected in the sectors. Info tech, consumer discretionary, financials, communications, real estate and energy are all up more than 15% since their Dec. 24 lows. Defensive sectors like utilities and staples have had the least animated run-up. However, perhaps the biggest evidence of a rush back to growth is seen once again in semiconductors. Semis were smoked last year and essentially a toxic wasteland. Yet the   is up 20% since Christmas – by far the best performer out there. We noticed a major repricing of semis last week with some stellar earnings and heavy institutional  . The first domino to fall may not get noticed until long after the fact. It helps to pay attention along the way and watch what the market tells us. The market has found its footing after a Montezuma's revenge incident due to forced ETF selling in the later half of last year. The usual worries still dominate, with renewed trade war anxiety stoked by Larry Kudlow last week. In what I see, big institutional investors have been plowing into stocks at breakneck speed, and now the ratio suggests that a pause is coming. I do believe that we will just resume course higher and that the market will become narrower. What looked like a desperate suicide was really set into motion by red bees. Heed the words of Billy Connolly: "Before you judge a man, walk a mile in his shoes. After that who cares? ... He's a mile away and you've got his shoes!" We continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term but see a risk of a near-term giveback. We see the year-to-date lift in stocks as very constructive. As growth stocks gain on increasing volumes, we believe that   could be better than overall expectations.

The World Bank sees Russia's economy growing just 1.5% in 2019 – down from 1.7% in 2018 amid risks from newly imposed western sanctions, rising  , lower oil prices, a weaker ruble and an expected tax increase. "In Russia, growth has been resilient, supported by private consumption and exports," the World Bank wrote in a report published earlier this month,  . "However, momentum has slowed, reflecting policy uncertainty, recent oil price declines, and renewed pressures on currency and asset prices, the bank added." Oleg Kouzmin, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, echoed similar sentiment. "The next year will be tough. Economic growth will slow amid an increase to the   (VAT), higher inflation and lending rates," Kouzmin  . Despite the bearish outlook surrounding Russia's economy, the country's stocks have stood out among emerging markets in early 2019. The nation's primary stock market index, the MOEX Russia Index, is up 12.95% year to date (YTD). Traders who want exposure to Russian issues should consider using one of these three   (ETFs). Let's discuss three trading ideas. Launched in 2010, the iShares MSCI Russia Capped ETF ( ) seeks to provide similar returns to the MSCI Russia 25/50 Index. The fund's portfolio contains companies listed on Russian stock exchanges with a strong tilt toward energy firms. Its top two holdings – PJSC LUKOIL (LUKOY) and PJSC Gazprom Neft (GZPFY) – have a cumulative weighting of 31.38%. ERUS, with   (AUM) of $558.97 million and offering a 4.13%  , has returned 11.88% YTD as of Feb. 11, 2019. Its   of 0.59% is moderate but above the 0.43% category average. Although the fund is below its 52-week high, its price is currently above a nine-month trading range that formed between April and December last year. The price has recently retraced to the top of this previous range, which now acts as a significant  . Swing traders should seek an entry point at $34 and think about booking profits on a move up to the $37 area, where the price may encounter   from the January and February 2018 swing highs. Consider positioning a   below the 50-day   (SMA). With net assets of $35.17 million, the VanEck Vectors Russia Small-Cap ETF ( ) aims to track the price and yield performance of the MVIS Russia Small-Cap Index. The ETF's benchmark consists of companies that generate at least 50% of revenue in Russia, regardless of their geographic location. RSXJ's basket holds 26 small-cap securities with a focus on industrial and financial stocks. Average volume of roughly 7,000 shares and a 0.64%   makes the fund more suited to swing trading rather than day trading. As of Feb. 11, 2019, RSXJ has returned a healthy 14.69% on the year and pays a dividend yield of nearly 4%. The ETF's 0.76% management fee is reasonable for a difficult-to-cover market. The fund's share price slumped roughly 34% between April and December but has staged a   in the first month and a half of 2019. The price has broken above a resistance area at $31 and sits just below the 200-day SMA. Aggressive traders could play the   and look to exit on a momentum move up to the next resistance level at $34. Alternatively, more conservative traders may wait for a pullback to $30, where the price finds support from a trendline connecting several reactionary swing points, before entering. Consider using a one-point stop to protect trading capital. Created in 2011 and yielding 1.66%, the Direxion Daily Russia Bull 3X ETF ( ) attempts to return three times the daily investment results of the MVIS Russia Index. The fund's use of   makes it a suitable instrument for those who want an aggressive bet on Russian stocks. RUSL's 1.28% expense ratio is high, but as the fund is only intended for short holding periods, it shouldn't overly affect traders' bottom line. Almost $5 million in average   takes place per day that provides reasonable liquidity for entering and exiting positions with minimal  . As of Feb. 11, 2019, the ETF is up 35.79% YTD, although returns get exposed to compounding effects due to the daily rebalancing of leverage. RUSL shares broke above an extended   and the 200-day SMA in late January that now both establish a crucial support area. Therefore, traders should consider going long if the price continues to   back toward the $38 level. An initial profit target could sit near $50 to catch a retest of the July swing high, while stop orders should sit just below the 50-day SMA to close losing trades.

The broad market continues to gain ground, cutting through obvious   while defying bearish predictions and weak sentiment. The uptick is reminiscent of V-shaped reversals in past years, sustained by nearly complete algorithmic control of price action. However, there are technical reasons for the advance because many securities hit key price levels or cyclical turning points in December, predicting stronger-than-expected first quarter price action. Federal Reserve caution and trade deal optimism are driving the upside as well, shaking out   and disbelievers while allowing the market to climb the "slope of hope." However, the Fed is more predictable at this point than a disruptive president who is being criticized by his followers for compromising with the opposition. This does not bode well for a bullish outcome in the China trade talks, which are scheduled to end in less than four weeks. Stronger-than-expected jobs and economic data are also lifting spirits, showing few signs of the slowdown anticipated by market analysts in the second half of 2018. Many American businesses continue to report robust sales, making it more likely that they will add employees in the coming months rather than tighten their belts with staff reductions. Of course, that could change with no China deal, so it's best to think twice before buying stocks or adding to long positions at these lofty levels.  The   has mounted resistance at the 200-day   (EMA) in the past week after climbing back above October and December lows in January. The last three moving average penetrations (gray boxes) dampened upside momentum, setting major highs into place. As a result, price action above $270 should be watched for a similar exhaustion event, keeping in mind that a rally into the December high at $280.40 would significantly improve the technical outlook.   The   illustrates long-term cyclical forces at play in the first quarter of 2019, with the steep decline into December 2018 reversing at the   of higher lows in place since the 2008 bear market. That price level also aligned perfectly with the 50-month and 200-week EMAs, which have also marked low-risk buying opportunities for the past decade. The monthly   dropped to the   level at that same time and crossed into a bull cycle, predicting six to nine months of  . The turnaround unfolded near the same level as indicator   in 2010, 2011 and 2015, which all preceded rallies to new highs. Of course, it could be different this time around, but bears should play defense until the ticker tape deteriorates.  component   highlights these technical influences as well, dropping into the 50-month and 200-week EMAs in November. Prior tests in 2009, 2013 and 2016 signaled major buying opportunities, all preceding new bull market highs. However, the extent of selling pressure was greater during the 2018   than in prior occurrences, building more layers of resistance that could slow or stall upside progress.  The monthly stochastics oscillator dropped into the oversold level for the first time since 2013 last month and turned higher but still hasn't crossed into a new buy cycle. Given stalling iPhone sales, what happens next may be instructive for broader price action. Specifically, a failure to complete a bullish crossover may indicate a lack of buying power that deteriorates improving sentiment. That could happen quickly if trade negotiations break off or the president renews his attacks on China. The bounce that started in late December is lasting longer and adding more points than many technicians expected, indicating a potential change in character that favors bulls.

Traders will often focus on the completion of a technical signal or a technical pattern in their analysis, as these events can mark the beginning of a new bullish or bearish move. But what happens when these signals and patterns fail? We're seeing an excellent example of a failed pattern on the crude oil chart today, as the commodity is falling back below the uptrending   of the   bullish reversal pattern it completed on Friday, Feb. 1. The break above the uptrending   last Friday signaled the beginning of what could have been a new bullish move for oil that, based on the height of the pattern, would have had an initial price target of $65.50 ($54.50 breakout point + $11 pattern height = $65.50 target price). Unfortunately for oil bulls, the price of oil closed below the uptrending level that served as the neckline of the pattern, which invalidates the inverse head and shoulders. It appears that commodity traders are viewing the move by the   (OPEC) to reach out and form a loose union with Russia and other former Soviet republics as a confirmation that oil demand is not keeping up with oil production. After all, OPEC, Russia and these other countries wouldn't need to form a union of any kind to produce more oil – only to coordinate a production reduction. This is all happening as Venezuelan oil tankers with approximately 7 million barrels of crude oil are stuck floating in the Gulf of Mexico with nowhere to go thanks to U.S. sanctions against Venezuelan oil.  Failed patterns have a high likelihood of moving in the opposite direction of the original breakout. There's no guarantee that this will happen for oil, but if the uptrending level that served as   for the left and right shoulders of the reversal pattern can't hold at $51.50, traders should watch for oil to retest its late-December 2018 lows. The   confirmed its bullish momentum once again today by not only closing higher but also continuing to ride the upper  . Many new chart technicians mistakenly believe that the upper Bollinger® band is likely to serve as a resistance level during uptrends and the lower Bollinger® band is likely to serve as a support level during downtrends. The opposite is true. When John Bollinger created his famous bands, he noted that the price of an asset riding along the upper band is a confirmation of bullish momentum, while the price of an asset riding along the lower band is a confirmation of bearish momentum. Seeing the S&P 500 continuing to climb the upper band tells us that the market may have enough momentum to revisit its former resistance level at 2,820. The   (VIX) dropped down and touched 15 today for the first time since Oct. 5, 2018. The VIX couldn't hold onto its intra-day lows, but this move shows that, halfway through the Q4 2018 earnings season, traders are starting to become more confident in the future of the U.S. stock market. It was at the beginning of the Q3 2018 earnings season – which got under way last October – that the VIX first started to show signs of stress as traders wondered if corporate earnings were going to be strong enough to sustain the bearish impact of rising interest rates. Fast forward to today, and traders are seeing companies continuing to beat earnings expectations at the same time that   are falling as the   (FOMC) slows its   program. At this rate, the VIX could be comfortably   between support at 11.5 and resistance at 15, like it did from July through September 2018 – a period of steady gains for the S&P 500. Whether you're looking at the charts of the major market indexes or the key risk indicators, you're seeing the same thing: bullish confirmation. Wall Street has come a long way back from its December 2018 drop, and it appears that even with the uncertainty still facing the global economy, traders are committed to climbing the  .

Although bullish confirmation is still valid, the major indexes stalled today as investors worried about trade and another possible government shutdown. I remain confident that one of the key factors that will send the market higher (or lower) is whether trade conditions between the U.S. and China improve (or deteriorate) compared with where they are now. As I have mentioned in previous Chart Advisor issues, the Chinese markets are unfortunately closed for the week, which means we're not getting any official data and it's unlikely that we will receive any updates on trade negotiations. However, we are able to see whether   in the U.S. relative to China is changing. Most of the   (ETFs) in the market that track Chinese stocks have Chinese or Hong Kongese-listed stocks in their portfolio. If the ETF trades on U.S. exchanges, investors can push the price of the ETF's shares higher or lower even if the prices of the underlying shares held by the fund are technically unchanged. The most recent market price of an ETF's holdings is called its   (NAV), which can deviate from the ETF's per-share price. If investors are feeling very confident about a market, the share price of a related ETF can rise above the fund's NAV per share. For example, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF ( ) has a net asset value based on last Friday's market price of $42.69. However, Tuesday's close price of the ETF's shares was $43.41, which indicated that investors were expecting the underlying stocks in the fund to rise in value once the holiday in China is over. Today, however, that excess valuation evaporated as   stocks dropped in value at a far faster pace than U.S. equities on Wednesday. As you can see in the following chart, FXI has had a fairly wide   over the past two days as investors try to price in the potential for changes in the U.S./China trade relationship. You will also notice that the ETF's chart makes it look like Chinese stocks are still struggling against  , which is not quite true if we look at Chinese stock indexes directly that are priced in  . However, in either case, the rally is still relatively new, and a breakout is uncertain until we get more positive news about trade negotiations. Part of the reason that ETFs holding shares of Chinese companies (and other emerging markets) look a little worse than the actual indexes for those stocks is due to a stronger dollar. If the dollar rises in value relative to the yuan or other emerging market currencies, it deflates the potential gains from those foreign investments and can increase the potential losses. For example, imagine that a group of foreign stocks held by an ETF has paid a   of 100 yuan but the value of the dollar has risen by 5%. When the dividend is translated from yuan into dollars, it will have lost 5% in that process. From March through October 2018, the dollar gained over 10% against the yuan, which reduced demand for Chinese investments. In the short term, a falling dollar would be supportive for international trade because it tends to be anti-inflationary in emerging markets and it makes U.S. goods more competitive. That should improve the U.S. trade deficit. A falling dollar is also a sign of confidence that investors are not seeking shelter from  . However, over the past five days, the dollar has been rising. As you can see in the following chart, the emerging   pattern in the dollar – which I mentioned in one of last week's Chart Advisor issues – has started to fade and is looking less likely to complete in the short term. In my view, it is unlikely that we'll see U.S. stocks back to their prior highs without an accompanying decline in the dollar. There are still a lot of earnings to be reported this week, including a few life insurance companies like Prudential Financial, Inc. ( ) and MetLife, Inc. ( ), which report late Wednesday afternoon. These reports should help us understand the outlook for corporate performance a little better. Life insurance companies are very sensitive to changes in interest rates and expected return from the market. If forward   provided by management at the insurance companies is positive, it's likely to give the markets another boost to the upside.

In the following chart, I have compared the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ) with the S&P 500 using five-minute   covering today's trading session. As you can see, there is a big difference in relative performance between the two asset classes. It may not sound surprising that utilities – a " " sector – would be outperforming the S&P 500 on the day the market was falling, but it is actually an important sign that investor sentiment is still relatively stable. If investors are aggressively selling equities, then utilities or other defensive sectors are likely to follow the trend. Conservative stocks and income payers may decline less in a market panic, but they still decline. We should be a lot more concerned about bearish sentiment if all sectors were in decline at the same time. Today I was interested in the apparent disconnect between what the headlines said about the market's drop and which stocks were actually in decline. For example, one of the most common "causes" blamed for the decline was a worry that President Trump and President Xi would not be meeting before the deadline for additional tariffs on Chinese imports in March. However, if that were true, we should have expected to see consumer stocks down a lot more on reduced margin expectations. However, even Walmart Inc. ( ) closed higher today. A bad day in the market is certainly disappointing, and worries over trade and a potential government shutdown are not helping to create any momentum. However, intermittent   are normal behavior for the market. In my opinion, the biggest issue that could really turn the indexes south is international growth, which has a relationship with international trade. However, that may be a tougher problem that can't be solved by just postponing tariff deadlines. The   index is sort of like the Dow Jones Industrial Average for Europe. As you can see in the following chart, the Euro Stoxx 50 failed at the 3,200   today after the European Commission downgraded its 2019 growth estimate for Italy to 0.2% from 1.2%. Economic concerns about Italy can put traders on edge because of the ongoing negotiations over Italian deficits, government spending and debt. If the Euro Stoxx 50 index pauses at 3,100 and moves higher again, we could see a bullish   pattern, which would likely be seen as a new buying opportunity in the market and is therefore worth watching closely over the next week or two. From a risk perspective, most indicators are flat or moving slowly, except for the U.S. dollar, which has been frustratingly bullish this week. As the market declined and earnings announcements in Japan disappointed, the dollar rallied again today. This is the sixth advance in a row, which may start to affect earnings expectations if the dollar moves beyond   and closer to its prior highs. Comparing the performance of risky assets (like small-cap stocks) to more conservative assets is a a great way to evaluate investor sentiment. I recommend using a   comparison to do analysis like that. For example, in the following chart, the price line represents the quotient of the   divided by the S&P 500, which will rise when small caps are outperforming less-risky large caps. In that respect, today's performance is better than it looked. Small caps continued to outperform large caps because they dropped less. In the chart, you can see that the relative performance of these two asset classes has a long-term pivot point near .56 that should be seen as a breakout point where investors will make another shift toward riskier assets. The last time this study was under .56 was during the 2015 "earnings recession," and it broke above again in November 2016 as the market went on another run to the upside. From a technical perspective, we can use a study like this to identify a point where investors are likely to start shifting in favor of higher prices. Right now, the study is headed in the right direction, and a clean break of .56 could send the market much higher. Positive news about trade, an improving outlook for first quarter earnings or rising energy prices could all be potential catalysts this month for a breakout like that. According to Zacks Investment Research, estimates for first quarter earnings growth across the S&P 500 is now -2% compared to the same quarter last year. Although growth rates are anticipated to return to positive territory later in the year, the negative outlook puts additional emphasis on any   during this quarter's earnings season. I still think the underlying fundamentals support a quick recovery in the second quarter, but preparing contingency plans and watching for key breakouts are always a good idea.

Sometimes the market makes big moves during market hours (between the opening bell at 9:30 a.m. and the closing bell at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time). During  , however, most of the big moves seem to happen during off hours when the market is closed. Facebook, Inc. ( ) shares made a major move last night after the company released its quarterly earnings numbers. Despite being embroiled in privacy-related controversies in jurisdictions around the world, the company managed to crush analyst earnings expectations. Facebook beat analyst revenue expectations by $510 million and earnings expectations by $0.20 per share – coming in at $16.91 billion and $2.38 per share, respectively. This news sent Facebook stock from its closing price of $150.42 on Wednesday, Jan. 30, to an after-hours high of $169.68. The stock did manage to climb a little bit higher than that during market hours today, reaching an intra-day high of $171.68, but most of the bullish move happened in the immediate aftermath of the earnings announcement. Seeing a stock   higher overnight like this can be frustrating for those investors who don't own the stock, but it certainly isn't abnormal price movement. Earnings season is a volatile time on Wall Street.  can cut both ways. Seeing a stock gap lower is just as likely as seeing a stock gap higher. Today just happened to be Facebook's day to gap higher with double-digit percentage growth. The   started its bullish breakout yesterday after the   (FOMC) announced that it was not going to be raising interest rates and that it was going to stop its   wind-down process earlier than previously expected. Wall Street responded so positively because lower interest rates and continued asset purchases by the FOMC are viewed as stimulative to not only the U.S. economy but also to the financial markets themselves. The index continued its bullish rally today as some of its biggest components rallied on Facebook's earnings news and expectations for Amazon.com, Inc. ( ) to beat earnings estimates after the closing bell. The S&P 500 is a   index. This means that the price movement of the stocks with larger market caps has a greater impact on the value of the index than the price movement of the stocks with smaller market caps does. Here's a list of the top 10 largest market cap stocks in the index: Out of these 10 stocks, only Microsoft and JPMorgan lost ground today. The other eight all rose, with Facebook leading the way as it climbed 10.82%. This was enough to push the S&P 500 out of the   range it has been in since Jan. 17 and up to the 61.8%   level of the bearish pullback the index suffered from late September to late December 2018. This level at 2,713.88 could serve as short-term  , but if earnings season continues to go well, the S&P 500 could easily retest the resistance level the index first established in mid-October at 2,820. The 10-year   (TNX) continued to collapse today as the market continues to readjust its expectations for how much of its portfolio the FOMC is going to continue to reinvest in Treasuries. Two weeks ago, the TNX was knocking on the door of breaking through resistance at 2.8%. Today, it closed at 2.64%. This reversal of fortunes appears like it might get worse since it wouldn't take much to push the indicator down to its Jan. 3 lows of 2.55%. As Treasury yields are falling, investors are selling bank stocks in anticipation of a flattening of the Treasury   and a compression of  . Net interest margin is the difference between the rate a bank pays to borrow money from its depositors and the amount the bank charges to lend money to its customers. The wider the margin, the more money the bank makes. Net interest margin tends to expand when the yield curve steepens and contract when the yield curve flattens. Falling longer-term Treasury yields – like the TNX or the 30-year Treasury Yield (TYX) – are putting downward pressure on the yield curve that is causing it to flatten out. Investors reacted to this movement today by selling shares of financial stocks like Bank of America Corporation ( ), Wells Fargo & Company ( ) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ( ). These stocks lost 2.06%, 2.36% and 2.21%, respectively, today. Watch for this bearish pressure to continue to be applied to the financial sector if yields keep dropping, causing these stocks to underperform stocks in the technology, consumer goods or health care sectors. One of the interesting themes that has developed during the S&P 500's month-long rally to start 2019 is that it has been a group effort. No one sector has led the way higher for the entire month.  Different news and economic announcements have caused investors to pass the baton back and forth from one sector to another. Financials started the year strong but are starting to fade back into the pack while tech and consumer stocks gather momentum. Watch for Wall Street to continue rewarding good news and punishing bad news, even if that news flips overnight.

The first Friday of each month (unless adjusted for a holiday) is the day that the   (BLS) releases the  . According to the BLS, 304,000 new jobs were added to the U.S. economy in January. This is well above the average, which is good news despite the fact that average hourly earnings rose much less than expected. However, just underneath the headline was a disappointing detail. The employment change for the month of December was originally 312,000 new jobs, which was revised down to 222,000 new jobs today. As you can see in the previous chart, the downward revision in the labor report had an impact on the trend of the data. However, in my opinion, the most important question is whether upward revisions are correlated with positive returns and downward revisions are correlated with negative returns in the market. Today's market wasn't necessarily negative, but it was sluggish compared with the post-Fed rally on Wednesday and Thursday. The last major positive revision was for June's employment data, which was revised higher by a combined 54,000 jobs on July 6 and Aug. 3. The market was breaking out to new highs during those positive revisions, which would seem to answer my question. However, if we look at positive or negative surprises in the labor report over a larger sample set, it cannot be shown to have any predictive value for what stock prices are likely to do over the next 30 days. That is important information for investors who are making trade decisions right now. Historically speaking, as long as the average non-farms employment change is positive, extended bear markets are unlikely. As long as the trend of hiring is flat or rising, stocks should still be in a good position for more gains in 2019. For additional historical context, keep in mind that the   didn't happen until the labor report had been trending below zero for a few months in 2008. This is a good thing to remember because traders are bound to get a little nervous next week. From a technical perspective, the S&P 500 is bumping up against its 61.8%   level, which is roughly equal to the bottoms in the index in May and June last year. Additionally, investors were doing some selling in Chinese stocks today ahead of the Spring Festival or New Year holiday next week. Chinese banks and equity markets will be closed all through next week, also disrupting the timing of Chinese economic announcements, which could be released unexpectedly later in February. I am a little concerned about the fact that Chinese markets will be "going dark" for a week, but there aren't a lot of other signs of stress in the market. Even the outlook for the   (VIX), or market "fear index," is looking a little better. Although the VIX has been stuck above 15 (usually a sign of bearishness) since last October, there is new evidence that it may finally break lower. Another version of the VIX that measures market expectations for   over the next nine days broke   today. As you might expect, the nine-day VIX moves very similarly to the VIX, but it can reveal emerging confidence more quickly because of its short-term outlook. As you can see in the following chart, the nine-day VIX dropped below support at 15 today, despite the fact that the major indices were oscillating around break-even throughout the session. We can interpret this movement in the nine-day VIX as a good sign that investors are not pricing in a lot of excess volatility due to the market holiday in China or earnings reports that will be streaming in over the next few days. As a counterpoint to the mixed labor report, the Institute for Supply Management's   (PMI) was released this morning, with an unexpectedly positive bounce off its two-year lows. Although the PMI is still well below its moving average, its a good sign that the reading of 56.6 was driven higher by the new orders index increasing at the fastest pace since 2014. The PMI report is one of my favorite monthly economic data releases because it is forward looking. The index is compiled from survey results of "purchasing managers" at manufacturers around the country. The metrics included in the overall score reflect what purchasing managers   for hiring, inventory, new orders, prices and overall production. Whether these professionals are correct about their estimates for the future is not as important as using the PMI report as a gauge of manufacturers' current confidence. In my view, today's report increases the potential for further gains across industrial stocks in February.

"Houston, we have a problem." This now-famous phrase was immortalized in the movie "Apollo 13." The ill-fated space mission was the seventh manned space mission of the Apollo program and the third that was supposed to make it to the moon. But two days after launch, an oxygen tank exploded and crippled the spacecraft. Against impossible odds, the crew of three returned safely to earth six days after launch. Now, the method that got them home was a bit of classic momentum. They performed a slingshot around the moon – a gravitational assist maneuver. They used the gravity of the moon to sling them around and hurdle them back toward earth. This method, while ingenious, may not have come from NASA itself, but from a hippy MIT grad student who called to offer his idea. This bold claim supposedly came from the ex-deputy chief of media relations during the time. Apparently, after meeting the long-haired guy, the space agency withdrew its invitation to present him to the president and public. (And the sign said, "Long-haired freaky people need not apply.") The power of momentum is immense and shouldn't be underestimated. The same gravitational slingshot effect has actually been observed at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. A supermassive black hole with a mass billions of times greater than our sun is literally flinging stars around it like toys. UCLA astronomer and professor Andrea Ghez did a 10-year time lapse observing stars doing exactly this at the center of our galaxy. You can see it  , and it still gives me goosebumps. In the depth of the market's December despair, many thought we were headed way lower. The pessimism resembled what many believed as it became clear that the Apollo 13 astronauts were drifting away from earth and closer to certain doom. Yet momentum slung them back to earth. So, is it really surprising to find that the pendulum swung so wildly from bearish to bring us so far back so quickly? Many news headlines hit recently saying that this January was the best since 1987. This seems wild considering we came from a December that was the worst since 1931. Yet here we are, and I ask: "Where have all the bears gone?" The headlines in December were soaked with the words " ." Websites were chock full of stories making all sorts of comparisons to 2008 and to the Great Depression. In retrospect, it was clearly out of hand, but then it was getting buy-in from the masses, and the fear was spreading rampantly. Where are those stories now? Where is the dread of global growth slowdown? Where is the doom and gloom? This is just a classic example of emotion and fear gripping hold of the market, only to give way to relief and complacency. But what's really going on here? We have already gone into terrific detail of how we believe that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were the main suspect in causing the calamitous selling of late 2018. If you haven't seen it, I wrote an exhaustive white paper on the subject for Navellier & Associates, which can be found  . But now that we have the all-clear and selling is done, we have witnessed a seismic shift – so much so that our ratio of buying to selling has skyrocketed from oversold (25%) to 72.5%. In four short weeks, we have seen hardly any selling signals and an abundance of buying. The   have clearly reversed course as their eternal thirst for   is getting quenched. What sectors have been leading the charge? We have seen a lot of buying in information technology and consumer discretionary. The financial sector has also seen a monstrous recovery from being grossly oversold. This is bullish when we see buying in these sectors on such a scale. These are growth-heavy sectors and decidedly "less defensive." It's worth noting that, even if this has been a monster  , it bodes well for the future. Forget for a moment that we did extensive research into 17 prior periods of sustained selling over the past 30 years. Forget for a moment that research showed us that, more than 80% of the time, one- through twelve-month forward returns were positive for the market. Forget those things. If shorts are covering and bears are running, that's a good sign. That said, we are cautious of the skewed buying. This   was highly pronounced. Investment managers   to deploy capital at the start of the year. This may have started the snowball rolling, but as we cap off the best January in more than 30 years, the setup is encouraging. Sales and earnings appear to be "not as bad as we thought." Semiconductors, the scapegoat whipping-boy industry sector for 2018, are showing some stellar earnings and also displaying monstrous buying. This crowded short saw momentum slingshot around the moon to be positive. This also foretells of opinions that global growth may not be as bad as previously portrayed. One other thing to notice in the current climate: negative news isn't working like it used to. Last year, negative stories morphed into instant fear and redness in the market. At the moment, it's just not working like that. Now   just needs to keep returning to the market. Our opinion was that the market backdrop was not as bearish as the popular opinion had become. We said that the market would bounce and move into a more selective phase of a  . Our view was unpopular for a few months as the market went south, but we read the signs that we saw. The Five Man Electrical Band had a great hit in 1971 in which they sang, "Sign, sign, everywhere a sign. Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind. Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?" The thing is, sometimes people don't want to read the signs. They just want to believe what they want to believe. We continue to be bullish on U.S. equities. We see the year-to-date lift in stocks YTD as very constructive. As growth stocks gain on increasing volumes, we believe earnings season could be better than overall expectations.

As I mentioned in last Friday's Chart Advisor newsletter, banks and stock markets in China and much of Asia will be closed for the Spring Festival or Lunar New Year holiday. This week marks the beginning of the Year of the Pig. This reminds me of the stock traders' adage "pigs get fed, and hogs get slaughtered." The saying is supposed to make the point that profit-seeking investors (pigs) can be successful over the long term, but overleveraged and inconsistent traders (hogs) will implode. Evaluating the current market environment for signs that the hogs are getting out of control is a good exercise.   for earnings in the first quarter of 2019 are near 0%, which could be another underestimate, but it certainly indicates a situation where appropriate judgment and discernment is important. An area of concern for me right now is valuations in the " ." For example, I ran an analysis today of the 50 largest stocks in the U.S. utilities sector, and the average   was 27, which is up from 23 in 2014. To put that in perspective, the average P/E ratio across the   has recently fallen to 20.85. Does it make sense that utilities should be one of the most highly valued sectors in the market? For most sectors, a high P/E ratio is a function of growth expectations. In other words, sectors that are growing tend to have high earnings multiples because profits are expected to rise quickly in the future. Therefore, in most cases, a high P/E ratio is not particularly worrisome. However, high growth rates and utilities do not usually go together. In my opinion, investors should be as picky as possible when considering the value of individual sectors to avoid the hogs. As you can see in the following chart of the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ), there is a key pivot level at $55 per share that, if valuations are already too extended, may be setting investors up for failure. The counterpoint to the defensive sectors, which seem overvalued, are the other groups that have likely been   during the market decline at the end of 2018. Technology is one of those sectors that seems likely still undervalued. For example, Alphabet Inc.'s ( ) earnings were released this afternoon and were above expectations ($12.77 per share vs. $10.86 estimated), which is another positive surprise in a sector that suffered some of the worst selling during the previous market decline. Alphabet is an important stock because most of its revenue and profitability is derived from advertising. If the consumer and business economies are doing well, then advertising rates are strong and Alphabet's earnings will be positive. This is often one of the first places we can detect underlying weakness in the economy if advertising spending rates are flat or negative. The bottom line is that, even if Alphabet stock is trading lower after the close on rising costs and lower margins (see chart below), the top- and bottom-line numbers should be supportive for the sector. I wouldn't be surprised to see prices rise again in tomorrow's session once investors have had a chance to digest the data. Most risk indicators are still signaling that there is little cause for concern in the near term across the broader market indexes. The bond, gold, small-cap and volatility indexes were all still headed the right direction today as the S&P 500 rallied. I was further encouraged by the improvement in the positioning of traders in the currency market. Although it isn't always a topic for financial headlines,   currencies like the Japanese yen usually fall when risk appetite is rising. Although the yen didn't decline very much in January, it is just starting to inch beyond short-term technical levels that should be supportive for higher stock prices. Although this can be confusing for non-forex traders, the chart below illustrates the amount the yen has fallen in value over the past two trading days against the U.S. dollar. When the chart is rising, that means it costs more weaker-yen to "buy" a dollar. A rising USD/JPY   is usually correlated with improving stock prices, and a falling USD/JPY rate can provide early warning signs of weakness. Bonds, stocks and risk indicators seem to be pointing the right direction for additional gains in February. However, using discretion when evaluating the relative risk of some traditionally "defensive" sectors is likely to be important for investors trying to maximize their profits and avoid the hogs.

Rising uncertainty about the future has investors across the globe concerned about growth of their investments. Many are in the process of seeking shelter from what could be another significant pullback, and traditional   such as gold, related commodities, bonds and   are gaining traction. In the paragraphs below, we'll take a look at the charts of several gold-tracking   (ETFs) and try to identify why now could be the ideal time to buy. Followers of technical analysis will often look to long-term indicators such as   and trendlines to gain insight about major shifts in the underlying fundamentals. These indicators can be used to accurately reflect investor sentiment and can provide clues as to future price action. On the chart of SPDR Gold Shares ( ) shown below, you can see that the 50-day moving average (blue line) has crossed beyond the 200-day moving average (red line) twice over the past year. The   between these two moving averages is one of the most common buy signs and is often used to mark the beginning of a major trend. Recent gains have triggered a bullish crossover, which suggest that we are in the early days of a long-term uptrend. Active traders will likely look to enter a position on any form of pullback toward the moving averages to increase the risk/reward of the position.   will most likely be placed below the combined   near $118. Investors who want to invest in gold but who are also interested in a broader holding in the overall previous metals segment may want to consider the ETFS Physical Precious Metals Basket Shares ( ). More specifically, this fund is often a favorite of traders who seek to own a basket of gold, silver, platinum and palladium bullion. Taking a look at the chart, you can see the pattern looks nearly identical to the one shown on GLD above. The bullish crossover between the long-term moving averages suggests that the uptrend is just getting started. From a   perspective, stop-loss orders will likely be placed below $61.11. Investors who are willing to take on risk could also be interested in the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF ( ). Of the group, this fund currently offers the most lucrative risk-to-reward ratio and has been relatively slow to adjust to rising prices of the underlying metals since the rise has occurred quite quickly. Assuming prices of the metals continue to trend higher, the group that will stand to benefit most will be the miners. Some traders may want to consider staying on the sidelines until the 50-day moving average is able to cross above the 200-day moving average, or for the price to close above the   of $21.54. In recent weeks, it has become increasingly difficult for active traders to find segments of the market that look poised for growth. Growing levels of geopolitical concern have some traders seeking shelter for their investments. Based on the charts shown above, it appears as though gold and related metals could be among the top choices to consider.

Commodity traders and other aficionados will be watching gold closely after Wednesday's Federal Reserve interest rate decision to see if the yellow metal can add to impressive gains that have stretched nearly 12% since August 2018. This buying impulse has now reached within four points of major   in place since 2013, with a breakout setting off the most potent buying signals since the start of the decade. Gold bugs have the Trump administration to thank for the uptrend, with the president's relentless attacks on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell forcing the central banker to reconsider an aggressive fiscal policy that initially scheduled at least four 2019 hikes. That number has dropped to two, according to the  , but benign   numbers and volatile world markets could send the number back to zero in the coming months. The Fed also has to consider that surging wage gains and inflationary pressures just haven't happened in an odd economic cycle that will soon stretch into its second decade. However, trade wars could ruin gold's bullish outlook, with commodity inflation skyrocketing due to higher costs while forcing the Fed to reinstate aggressive rate hikes. For now at least, optimism about a China deal is riding high, allowing this unique financial instrument to climb the slope of hope. The SPDR Gold Trust ( ) ended a modest uptrend at $72.26 in 2006 and pulled back into the mid-$50s a few months later. It broke out above range   in 2007 and reversed at the psychological $100 level ($1,000 on the underlying commodity), dropping into a test of new   during the October 2008 crash. That marked a historic buying opportunity, ahead of a powerful trend advance that lifted into the triple digits in the fourth quarter of 2009. The uptrend finally ended in September 2011, yielding a   top, with horizontal support near $150. Keep that level in mind because it now marks the logical upside target if gold can break multi-year resistance in the coming weeks. It broke down in 2013, entering a steep downtrend that eased into a   a few months later, and continued to post lower lows into 2015's six-year low at $100.23.  A bounce into 2016 stalled above $130 at the .382   level of the three-year decline, printing the highest high in the past two and a half years. Price action since that time has held within the boundaries of the 2015 into 2016  , denying profits to both bulls and bears, while minor rallies have carved a trendline of lower highs that now marks major resistance. The latest uptick has now reached within four points of this barrier, raising hopes for a breakout. Price action has been contracting since 2016, with higher lows and lower highs similar to a triangle pattern. This loss of   is typical at the end of a long-term downtrend and could be signaling that the time is right for the yellow metal to bust out of the long-term range in a trend advance that pleases long-suffering gold bugs. However, there's no advantage in taking early exposure because a lot of things can go wrong between now and then. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator confirms growing bullishness, lifting to the highest high since April 2013. It's now situated just above 2016 and 2018 peaks that printed during the past two trendline reversals. Given this structure, it makes sense to watch the indicator closely if the rally surges into resistance, looking for telltale buying or selling pressure that generates an early signal for a breakout or another downturn. Gold is approaching trendline resistance going back to 2013, setting the stage for a key test that could trigger the strongest uptrend since 2011.

Today is another Fed day, when the   (FOMC) announces whether the overnight target rate will be raised, left flat or reduced. Today's decision to leave the   flat isn't much of a surprise. The Fed said that it would be "patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the   may be appropriate," for full employment and inflation targets. I thought the most important statement from the Fed is that it's prepared to make adjustments in its plans for balance sheet normalization. Like any other bank, the Fed has a   that reflects its liabilities and assets. Since the launch of   in 2008, the Fed has been buying   and other fixed-income instruments, which are reflected on the asset side of its balance sheet (see the following chart). If the Fed starts selling the trillions of dollars in bonds that it owns, it could drive the price of bonds lower. Investors care about the potential for the Fed selling bonds and "normalizing" its balance sheet because falling bond prices will result in higher longer-term interest rates. Many investors worry that rising long-term interest rates would slow the U.S. economy because the   will rise, although historical evidence does not show a good correlation between those two factors. Regardless of whether everyone agrees about the impact of higher long-term interest rates, the dovish tone in the Fed's announcement today is seen as a positive for U.S. and   stocks. Lower interest rates in the U.S. are positive for emerging market economies because they should push the value of the U.S. dollar down, which keeps the pressure off of domestic emerging market currencies. As I have pointed out over the past month in the Chart Advisor newsletter, emerging markets (especially China) are already showing an increased likelihood for outperformance over the next six months. As you can see in the following chart, the iShares Emerging Market ETF ( ) has mirrored the performance of the Hang Seng index and confirmed its own   breakout today. In my experience, a   – anchored at the high of the double bottom and the most recent low – can be used to provide a reliable target at the 161.8% retracement level of the pattern. Without the headwind of a rising dollar, it should be much easier for emerging stocks to reach their prior highs from last July. The risk posed by a rising dollar is not just an issue for emerging markets. I have been very concerned that the bullish dollar of 2018 would wind up crushing the U.S. industrial sector. If the dollar is rising against most other currencies, that means exports from U.S. manufacturers are less competitive internationally. In this respect, I see two positive developments today. First, the Fed did a lot to put traders at ease about rising interest rates in the short term, which should push the value of the dollar lower. Second, the earnings report from The Boeing Company ( ) this morning provided a lot of good news for manufacturers concerned about slowing in China and other emerging markets. Boeing exceeded estimates for top- and bottom-line performance and reached a new all-time sales record of over $100 billion. If industrial firms are not in as dire a situation as investors had feared prior to earnings, and the dollar starts to fall, industrials and other multinational firms could be seriously  . You can see this relationship that I have discussed between the value of the U.S. dollar (candlesticks) and industrial stocks (blue line represented by the SPDR Manufacturing and Industrial ETF,  ) in the following chart. The inverse relationship is imperfect, but historically, a rise in the U.S. dollar like the one we experienced in 2018 is usually accompanied by devaluation in industrial stocks and economic uncertainty. Something very similar to this occurred in 2014 just prior to the "earnings recession" of 2015. This earnings season continues to look better than expected, but I am still waiting to see how consumer stocks look once the bulk of those reports are released early next month before completely sounding the "all clear." In the meantime, I will use upcoming Chart Advisor newsletters to take a closer look at oil stocks and utilities as the situation in Venezuela progresses and the so-called " " increases demand for energy and commodities throughout the Midwest. There could be some interesting opportunities in those two stock categories for risk-tolerant investors in the short term.

Brazil has reclaimed its mantle of "  darling" in early 2019, with the country's stock market outperforming those in other developing nations such as China, Mexico and South Korea. Its benchmark, the Bovespa Index (^BVSP), has started the year surging 10.4%. Reforms and business-friendly rhetoric outlined by Brazil’s newly minted right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro at the   in Switzerland last week has given investors hope that Latin America's largest economy has an administration that intends to turn things around. Bolsonaro, a retired military officer, said he plans to reform Brazil's strickened   system by increasing the retirement age and rolling back a range of benefits. He also mentioned that he intends to reduce and simplify taxes,   state companies and tackle corruption in an attempt to open the country's economy up to foreign investment. "We enjoy the credibility to carry out reforms that we need and the world expects of us," Bolsonaro told the Davos audience,  . Traders who monitor developments in Brazil should keep these three   (ETFs) on their radar. Let's point out significant   levels to watch. Launched back in 2000, the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF ( ) seeks to provide similar investment results to the MSCI Brazil 25/50 Index. The fund's portfolio holds Brazilian companies across the broad market cap spectrum, with a 35% tilt toward the financials sector. Its ultra-thin   of 0.03% and average daily   of more than 20 million shares per day make it a traders' favorite in the Brazil ETF space. As of Jan. 31, 2019, EWZ offers a 2.88%   and is up an impressive 13.72% year to date (YTD). The fund has a reasonable 0.59% management fee and controls $7.69 billion in net assets. EWZ has formed a rising   – typically a bearish chart pattern – over the past six months. However, price nudged above the pattern's upper   Wednesday, which suggests that bulls want to test 2018 highs. If the fund stalls here, look for a move back down toward the rising wedge's lower trendline, where buyers may step back up to the plate. Created in 2009, the VanEck Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF ( ), with   (AUM) of $88.4 million, aims to provide similar returns to the MVIS Brazil Small-Cap Index. The tracked benchmark, as its name suggests, consists of mostly small-cap Brazilian companies. BRF's   comprises 60 holdings, with key names including CVC Brasil Operadora e Agencia de Viagens SA (CVCB3.SA), Transmissora Alianca de Energia Eletrica SA (TAEE11.SA) and Companhia de Saneamento do Paraná – SANEPAR (SAPR11.SA). The ETF's spread of 0.60% makes it more suited to   rather than scalpers. With only 26,000 shares changing hands daily, traders must also be mindful of liquidity. BRF charges a 0.60% management fee and has a YTD return of 11.64% as of Jan. 31, 2019. Like EWZ, the fund's price has traded in an orderly rising wedge formation since mid-September. The 50-day   (SMA) crossed above the 200-day SMA in December, which technicians refer to as a " " – a signal that indicates further upside momentum. Yesterday's strong close above the rising wedge pattern may see price run to the February 2018 swing high, although a short-term overbought reading of above 70.0 on the   (RSI) may see the fund fall to the wedge's lower trendline before making a serious upwards push. The Direxion Daily MSCI Brazil Bull 3X ETF ( ), formed in 2013, attempts to return three times the daily performance of the MSCI Brazil 25/50 Index – the same benchmark used by EWZ. This   fund suits those who want to an aggressive short-term play in Brazilian stocks. Its decent exposure to financials ties performance closely with the health of the country's economy. BRZU's 1.15%   is pricey but shouldn't overly affect traders' bottom line if used for short stays only. More importantly, the ETF's tight spread of 0.10% and ample liquidity keep trading costs low. As of Jan. 31, 2019, the fund, with AUM of $338.06 million and yielding just over 1%, has returned 44.21% YTD. BRZU's share price poked above the upper trendline of a rising wedge in Wednesday's session. With an RSI reading below 70.0, the bulls may find more room to run before a   period or retracement. If the fund does encounter some selling pressure from the bears, don't be surprised to see it retrace to the rising wedge's lower trendline at $26, where it also finds   from the 200-day SMA.

Snap Inc. ( ) shares rose more than 12% during Thursday's session after BTIG upgraded the stock from Neutral to Buy with a   of $15.00 per share, representing a nearly 50% premium to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst noted the rise in domestic ad spending in the second half of 2018, higher-quality content, better user engagement, recent executive hires and a clearer strategic plan as its rationale. The move follows Consumer Edge Research's initiation of coverage on Snap stock earlier this week with a price target of $14.00 per share. Despite the stock trading sharply off of its 52-week highs, investor confidence in a turnaround has prompted Snap to nearly double in price since its strong fourth quarter results. Bullish analysts raised their price targets in response to those financial results, but bearish analysts see further downside. Snap faced turmoil last year following its poorly received redesign, tough comps from the prior year and a government probe stemming from a class action lawsuit over its initial public offering. Investors are hoping that these issues are in the past and that management can move forward with a focus on growth. From a technical standpoint, the stock rebounded from the lower end of its price channel to R1   at $11.25. The   moved back into overbought territory with a 77.70 reading, but the   (MACD) could see a bullish crossover. These indicators suggest that the stock could see some near-term   before an extended move higher. Traders should watch for consolidation below R1 resistance at $11.25 and above trendline   at $10.00 over the coming sessions. If the stock breaks out from R1 resistance, traders should watch for a move toward upper trendline and R2 resistance at $12.69. If the stock breaks down from trendline support, traders may see additional support at the 200-day   of $9.25 or the   at $8.97.

Investors looking for tech stocks that can rise faster than the rebounding group of FAANGs may consider three smaller e-commerce players that are already leading the market and are poised to outperform longterm, according to some market watchers. Stitch Fix Inc. ( ) has soared about 82% this year, Wayfair Inc. ( ) has gained nearly 84% and Etsy Inc. ( ) is up almost 46%, compared to a 13% rise for FAANG rival Amazon.com Inc. ( ). These lesser-known e-commerce companies, which are successfully growing in Amazon's shadow, have also posted better returns than the other four FAANGS this year. Despite their recent outperformance, the stocks still have room to rebound as they all are trading sharply below their highs. These 3 stocks are likely to surge higher if the companies continue to expand. Their gains were detailed in a   story. (YTD Stock Performance) Earlier this week, Stitch Fix skyrocketed 40% on better-than expected earnings, sales and active customers for the recent quarter. The company also gave strong full-year guidance. While the stock has risen nearly 82% in 2019, it still remains 40% below its 2018 highs. RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney lifted his forecasts for Stitch Fix based on those results, per  . “We now see a near-term outlook for stable or even accelerating active clients. More important, we are increasingly impressed by the consistency of Stitch Fix’s financial results,” said Mahaney. He now expects to stock to jump almost 67% over 12 months to reach $52, up from his previous price forecast. S&P Global’s Erin Gibbs and Newton Advisors’ Mark Newton regard Etsy as one of the premier picks among online retailers. “I like Etsy quite a bit. … [It] has just broken out a couple of weeks ago and has really been consolidating of late,” said Newton, per CNBC. And Gibbs says Etsy's stable earnings growth is a strong point. "Etsy is the one that really is growing steadily and actually has expanding profits," she said. While these smaller stocks are flying high now, disruptions in the broader market or their industry niches could cause them to pull back more quickly than the FAANGs. A pullback and even an economic recession would test the mettle of these young techs, and would determine whether they have the ability to grow their earnings, sales and share prices longterm.

Regional banking stocks gained investors' focus this week after the Federal Reserve Board approved Fifth Third Bancorp's ( ) application to acquire Chicago-based MB Financial, Inc. ( ) in a deal valued at $4.7 billion. The  , once complete, builds Fifth Third's position in the Chicago market. "From the outset, we have viewed MB Financial as a unique partner in our efforts to build scale in this strategically important market," Fifth Third CEO Greg Carmichael said in a news release,  . Fifth Third's acquisition approval comes just a month after SunTrust Banks, Inc. ( ) and BB&T Corporation ( ), two prominent southern regional banks, announced a $66 billion   – a deal that will create the sixth largest bank in the United States. Analysts credit a rollback in   as the catalyst driving increased merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the sector. "The new regulation breaks banks down into five different categories according to their asset levels, and the regional banks of assets between $100 billion and $250 billion have less strict regulations than the bigger banks with let's say over $700 billion," Mark Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners,  . From a   standpoint, regional banking stocks look like they could continue their first quarter momentum and push through a wall of near-term  . Those looking to swing trade a sector rife with M&A activity should add these three regional banking heavyweights to their  . Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp provides a variety of financial services through its business  . These include Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth & Asset Management. The regional bank's 1,121 full-service banking centers primarily operate throughout Midwestern states. Fifth Third Bancorp topped analysts' fourth quarter  , reporting earnings per share (EPS) of 69 cents in the period. The company said profitable relationship growth and improved balance sheet resiliency underpinned growth over the period. It also mentioned that ongoing MB Financial integration efforts and a clearly defined set of strategic priorities for the future should allow the bank to reach its long-term financial targets. Trading at $28.41 with a   of $18.43 billion and offering an attractive 3.31%  , the stock is up 20.74% year to date (YTD), outperforming the S&P 500 by nearly 9% as of March 15, 2019. Fifth Third's chart shows an   pattern forming over the past five months. Throughout the week, the stock convincingly pushed above the bottoming pattern's neckline and the 200-day   (SMA) as investors cheered the bank's acquisition approval. Traders who buy the breakout should place a   beneath this month's swing low and look for the price to test the   from May 21, 2018, at $30.95 – ironically, the gap resulted from the merger announcement. With a market cap of $58.79 billion, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ( ) offers its customers a range of financial services including retail and corporate banking,   as well as residential mortgage banking. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, the regional bank operates a network of roughly 2,500 branches and over 9,000 ATMs across 19 states and the District of Columbia. Despite the company missing analysts' fourth quarter   projections, PNC Financial sits well positioned to benefit from increased margins, an improved lending environment and a diversified revenue mix. As of March 15, 2019, the stock issues a 3.02%   and has a YTD return of 11.67%. After nosediving 22% from high to low in December, the PNC Financial share price recovered remarkably well in January – recouping roughly half of those losses. The stock's price spent February   and has started to grind higher again in early March. The bulls' next major hurdle is breaking through a confluence of resistance at the $131 level, where the price may find headwinds from a long-term   line and the 200-day SMA. If the stock moves above this area, expect a push to the next level of significant resistance at $137.50. Those who play the breakout could trail a stop order several   below the entry to ride momentum as far as possible. KeyCorp ( ) engages in retail and commercial banking with a focus on   commercial clients through a hybrid community/corporate bank model. Although the Cleveland-based bank operates in 16 states, the Ohio and New York markets drive the lion's share of its revenue. KeyCorp posted fourth quarter adjusted EPS of 48 cents, beating the Street's predictions of 47 cents. Improvement in   and a reduction in expenses drove income over the period. The Midwest bank trades at 10.2 times earnings, lower than the industry average multiple of 12.6. KeyCorp stock has a $17.57 billion market cap and is up 19.01% on the year as of March 15, 2019. Investors receive an enticing 4.07% dividend yield. KeyCorp's share price appears to be forming an inverse head and shoulder pattern, with the right shoulder completing this week. Traders could either play an initial breakout of the pattern's neckline and a seven-month   at $17.50 or wait for the price to clear the resistance area and buy the first  . Think about setting a   near $21 – in the proximity of last summer's swing high.

Nasdaq 100 component Adobe Inc. ( ) reports first quarter results after Thursday's closing bell, with analysts expecting   (EPS) of $1.62 on $2.54 billion in revenues. The company met fourth quarter estimates in December, triggering an aggressive sell-the-news reaction that dumped the stock more than 7% in two sessions. Confusion may have generated the majority of downside at that time, with the late-year acquisition of automation software provider Marketo obscuring bottom-line results and forward  . Sentiment has improved greatly in the past three months, lifting the digital media giant within eight points of 2018's all-time high at $278. Even so, Wall Street analysts have issued mixed messages, with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch raising its   to $312 on Wednesday after February downgrades by Cowen and DZ Bank. Both bulls and bears will be listening closely during the conference call for additional disclosures about the acquisition's financial impact. The stock hit a four-year low at a   $2.95 at the end of 1998 and turned sharply higher, breaking out to a new high in 1999, ahead of a parabolic buying wave that topped out at $43.65 in November 2000. That marked the highest high for nearly seven years, ahead of a downtrend that posted a long series of lower lows before finding   at a three-year low in the single digits in the third quarter of 2002. That marked the lowest low in the past 16 years, giving way to a steady uptick that stalled less than three points under the 2000 high in 2006. The stock finally mounted that   in the second half of 2007, but momentum failed to develop, topping out one month later after adding just five points. The subsequent reversal failed the breakout, generating a decline that accelerated during the 2008 economic collapse. Adobe shares bounced in the mid-teens in 2009, while the subsequent uptick took more than four years to complete a 100%   into the 2007 high, yielding an immediate breakout. That buying surge signaled the start of a leadership phase that posted impressive gains into September 2018's all-time high at $277.61.   spiked sharply in the fourth quarter, breaking major support in the $230s, ahead of a 2019 uptick that has healed the majority of the technical damage. The monthly   fell into a sell cycle in September 2018 but crossed over in January before reaching the oversold level, highlighting unusual  . The turnaround has matched bullish price action that has now retraced about 80% of the 2018 decline. Unfortunately for bulls, the weekly indicator has just entered a sell cycle that predicts four to ten weeks of technical headwinds, suggesting that bears will prevail following this week's report. A   stretched across the 2018 downtrend supports this cautious view, hitting the .786 retracement level in mid-February and whipsawing across that harmonic barrier into mid-March. The weekly stochastics oscillator reflects this ongoing conflict, generating a bearish crossover because the stock has failed to hold onto gains above $260. Even so, the bullish backdrop will continue as long as price action trades above the 50-day   (EMA) near $250. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator also supports a mixed outlook, testing October's all-time high in December and posting a lower high in mid-February, at the same time the rally reached the .786 retracement level. Stealth-like selling pressure since that time may signal that institutions are taking profits and hitting the sidelines because they expect a downturn in the coming weeks. Adobe reports first quarter earnings on Thursday evening after seeing its stock price lift nearly 30% in less than three months. Given these windfall gains, it may take a blowout quarter to avoid a pullback that targets the 200-day EMA at $240.

Facebook, Inc. ( ) stock has been recovering from a bear market decline of 43.7% from its all-time intraday high of $218.62 set on July 25 to its Dec. 24 low of $123.02. The stock closed Wednesday, March 13, at $173.37, up 32.3% so far in 2019 and in bull market territory at 40.9% above the Christmas Eve low. Even so, the stock remains in the longer-term bear market at 20.7% below the all-time high. My concerns surfaced on Wednesday when I could not post my stories on my Facebook pages. I did not see any warnings on financial TV, nor did I get a message from Facebook other than a terse message when attempting to upload my stories: "Sorry, this feature isn't available right now: An error occurred while processing this request. Please try again later." I did not know whether it was an issue with my computer or a Facebook issue. I rebooted my computer and that did not help! A third party sent out a message around 3:00 p.m.: "Facebook suffering widespread outages: Instagram, WhatsApp also affected." This morning, we found out that there is another Facebook issue to worry about. Federal prosecutors are investigating data deals that Facebook made with several global technology companies. This just continues a litany of scandals we have seen over the past year or so. One issue is that some makers of smartphones are gaining access to the personal information for millions of Facebook users. The company suffered privacy scandals during 2018 that were forgiven as the stock set its all-time intraday high of $218.62 set on July 25. This was the day when Facebook reported disappointing quarterly earnings and was followed by a huge price   lower on July 26. Given these uncertainties, I believe it is time to book profits and reduce holdings in shares of Facebook. The daily chart for Facebook shows the stock above its 200-day   at $165.41, which is a key level to hold on weakness. Note that Facebook shares have been trading around the 200-day moving average since Jan. 31, when the stock popped to this level on a positive reaction to earnings. Look back to July 25, which is when the stock gapped lower on a significant earnings miss. The close of $131.09 on Dec. 31 was input to my proprietary analytics. This resulted in my annual, semiannual and quarterly risky levels at $181.70, $189.47 and $200.75, respectively, which suggests that a new all-time high is highly unlikely in 2019. On Feb. 28, the stock closed at $161.45, which was also an input to my analytics. This resulted in my monthly value level well below the market $122.54. The weekly chart for Facebook is positive but  , with the stock above its five-week modified moving average at $161.24 and above its 200-week simple moving average, or " ," at $139.93. The stock has been above its "reversion to the mean" since the close on Jan. 4. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow   is projected to end this week at 82.46, above the overbought threshold of 80.00. Note that, when the stock set its all-time high on July 25, the stochastic reading was at 93.47, above the 90.00 Ievel that I describe as an "inflating parabolic bubble." This was the first technical warning to reducing holdings. The horizontal lines are the   levels of the decline from $218.62 on July 25 to the Dec. 24 low of $123.02. The stock is just below its 50% retracement at $170.82. Reduce holdings in Facebook shares now and on strength to my annual risky level at $181.70. I do not have a nearby level at which to buy. My value levels and risky levels are based on the past nine weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes. The first set of levels was based on the closes on Dec. 31. The original quarterly, semiannual and annual levels remain in play. The weekly level is changed each week, while the monthly level was changed at the end of January and February. My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility, investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before the time horizon expires.

General Electric Company ( ) stock is trading nearly 4% higher on Thursday morning after Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr. provided fiscal year 2019   that was below consensus estimates. The buy-the-bad-news reaction could signal better times for beaten-down shareholders, indicating that sellers may have finished their work after a massive two-year decline. Even so, the company faces a major challenge in restoring its tarnished reputation after years of corporate neglect. GE expects 2020 and 2021 adjusted industrial   to be positive after a negative 2019. The stock sold off nearly 8% on March 5 after the company disclosed the 2019 deficit, while this morning's positive view for future years offers a potential light at the end of a dark tunnel. That may be sufficient to print a long-lasting bottom, but healthy returns aren't likely until the company makes good on a long string of bad predictions about future results. Despite this morning's bullish reaction, it's hard to recommend buying GE stock at the current price because it's still trading below   at a declining highs trendline in place since a January 2018 breakdown. A rally above the trendline and 200-day   (EMA) near $11 is now needed to improve the 2019 technical outlook and support modest upside into the mid- to upper teens. The stock turned higher from the single digits in 1994 when the company was taking advantage of new international opportunities after the fall of communism. The rally went parabolic in 1998, lifting to an all-time high at $58.41 in August 2000. It reversed and dropped like a rock after the   burst, dumping to a five-year low near $20 in the fourth quarter of 2002. That marked the lowest low for the next six years, ahead of a bounce that stalled in the mid-$30s in 2005. GE shares mounted that resistance level in 2007, but upside momentum failed to develop, reversing after adding just four points, ahead of an orderly downturn that escalated into a full-scale panic when GE Capital got stuck with bad loans during the 2008 economic collapse. The decline nearly drove the company into bankruptcy before the stock bottomed out at a 17-year low in the single digits in March 2009. The subsequent bounce carved a slow-motion uptick that ran out of steam in July 2016 near the .786   level of the 2007 into 2009 downtrend. The stock broke down from an 18-month top in 2017, entering a historic decline that paused or bottomed out in December 2018, less than one point above the 2009 low. The monthly   entered the most impressive buy cycle since 2015 in January 2019, raising hopes for additional upside. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator topped out with price in 2016 and entered an aggressive distribution phase that escalated in the second half of 2018, dumping to the lowest low in more than a decade. It turned higher in January, with value players and bottom fishers opening positions in hopes of a long-term turnaround. However, this buying power barely registers in the multi-year view, telling market players that the recovery could take years to complete. The bounce into February 2019 stalled at the 200-day EMA and declining highs trendline going back to January 2018. This marks the first time the stock has reached the 200-day EMA resistance since April 2017, denoting a modestly bullish milestone. The subsequent decline filled two downside  , while two unfilled upside gaps stand out like sore thumbs above $17. As a result, that level will mark a profit target if the stock can mount resistance now centered near $11. General Electric stock is trading higher after the conglomerate lowered 2019 guidance, but it needs to rally above tough resistance at $11 to attract sustained buying interest.

Forecasting the future direction of the stock market is a hazardous business, and even the most eminent experts are frequently wrong. Nonetheless, investors need some sense of the road ahead, and two notable figures worth heeding are billionaire investment guru   of Berkshire Hathaway and   Robert Shiller of Yale University. Each has a favored stock market valuation method, both of which are followed closely by financial experts who use them to forecast market trends. The latest forecasts, based on Buffett's and Shiller's methods, indicate stock market annual returns will slow drastically--or even decline--over the next 10 years. The forecasts based on these methods were compiled by the respected New York economist and financial expert, Stephen Jones, in a detailed story in MarketWatch. (See table below.) (  Performance Over Next 10 Years) Buffett has said in the past that the ratio of the S&P 500 Index to U.S.   is "probably the best single measure of where   stand," per MW. He hasn't made recent public comments on this matter, but there is no evidence that his view has changed. For this ratio to revert to long-term historical averages gradually over the next 10 years, the S&P 500 would fall by 2.0% per year. Nonetheless, Buffett's public statements indicate he still prefers stocks to bonds right now. "If I had a choice today for a 10-year purchase of a 10-year bond at whatever it is...or buying the S&P 500 and holding it for 10 years, I'd buy the S&P 500 in a second," he told   recently. Buffett is not the first person to suggest this metric. A similar one is the  , associated with the late James Tobin, also a Nobel laureate. Q Ratio analysis suggests that stocks will fall 0.5% per year over the next decade. Shiller formulated the cyclically-adjusted price/earnings ratio ( ), based on inflation-adjusted average   over the past 10 years. This method is supposed to smooth the passing effects of the   and one-off events on earnings. While offering no specific predictions,   that valuations have been high relative to historic norms, and that low returns going forward are thus likely. Based on CAPE methodology, MW projects that real total returns, adjusted for inflation and including dividends, will average 2.6% annually over the next decade. The current   for the S&P 500 is 2.0%, per  . This implies that the inflation-adjusted average annual increase in the value of the S&P 500 will be only about 0.6%. The projections offered above rest on assumptions about GDP, corporate earnings, and inflation over the next decade that could change dramatically--and thus alter the market's direction. Regarding Buffett's favored ratio, rising GDP down the road could support further gains in the S&P 500. And in the case of Shiller's CAPE ratio, if earnings grow, and inflation stays low, that may justify even greater future annual returns than 2.6%. But the reality of today's market--driven by slowing GDP growth and slashed profit forecasts--suggests that the grim forecasts of these two market wizards' models may be accurate.

With huge uncertainties surrounding  , Britain's planned withdrawal from the  , the vast majority of investors are wary of buying European stocks. However, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley see great opportunities in the region's severely beaten-down equities, which BofAML calls the "ultimate   trade," per a detailed story in  . “Given the low starting point for both sentiment and relative  , we believe even a modest incremental improvement in the European macro backdrop should be helpful for European equities’ relative performance going forward,” Graham Secker, chief European equity   at Morgan Stanley, told clients in a note cited by Bloomberg. The table below summarizes the categories of European stocks favored by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley's and BofAML's contrarian strategy got a boost Wednesday when British lawmakers, in a surprise move, voted against a no-deal exit from the EU. While much uncertainty remains, the vote reduces the odds of a disruptive U.K. exit that would hurt the region's economies, according to the Wall Street Journal. Morgan Stanley and BofAML are not alone in their enthusiasm for European stocks. “Buying when valuations are at generational lows is the opportunity of a generation. As special-situations investors, we have seen the number of companies going through strategic change grow dramatically, giving us compelling potential investments," David Marcus,   of Evermore Global Advisors, told the news wire. European equities drastically lagged major indexes in the past decade. During the 10 years through March 12, 2019, the   delivered an average annual return of 10.42%, versus 6.61% for the MSCI Europe Index, which includes only developed economies, per  . The performance of European stocks versus global stocks has trended downwards since 2002, Bloomberg calculates. This is one indicator of the attractive valuations that bullish strategists see. Rather than rushing to grab bargains, investors have been fleeing European equity funds. Through late February, net withdrawals were about $120 billion across the prior 12 months, including about $26 billion since the start of 2019, per data from EPFR Global in the article. Investors "are waiting for more clarity on the political front" before buying, observes Wouter Sturkenboom, chief investment strategist for Europe at Northern Trust Asset Management. The situation is getting murkier, however. The latest Brexit deal proposed by U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May was voted down overwhelmingly in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Brexit already has created huge uncertainties for businesses in both Britain and the continent, and a delay is one possible scenario after the vote. The deceleration of the European economy is another cause of concern. "Investors will likely stay on the sidelines until we get the promise of a lasting recovery in growth," says Tilmann Galler, Frankfurt-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, per Bloomberg. Damien Loh, chief investment officer of Singapore-based   Ensemble Capital, sees rising odds of a "no deal Brexit," and believes the market is not pricing in the negative consequences of this possibility, per another   article. If that happens, the risks could rise dramatically for Morgan Stanley's and BofAML's contrarian strategy.

Aurora Cannabis Inc. ( ) shares rose more than 10% during Wednesday’s session after the company engaged billionaire Nelson Peltz to advise it on potential partnerships and global expansion plans. Peltz is best known for taking   positions in The Procter & Gamble Company ( ), The Wendy's Company ( ) and other corporate giants.  GMP Securities analyst Marin Landry upgraded Aurora Cannabis stock from Hold to Buy and raised his   to $15.00 following the new appointment, saying that Peltz could be "instrumental" in facilitating partnership talks with large consumer packaged goods companies. Landry added that the fully licensed Bradford and Aurora Sky facilities should alleviate inventory concerns. Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett noted that Peltz could help Aurora focus on assets that yield the most value. In the past, some investors have criticized the company for excessive spending on numerous assets across the value chain with little apparent concern over the  . Peltz could help support a focus on achieving profitability. From a technical standpoint, Aurora Cannabis stock broke out from an   chart pattern to briefly hit R2 resistance at $9.19 before turning lower. The   (RSI) approached overbought levels at 68.65, while the   (MACD) may have experienced a slight bearish crossover. These indicators suggest that traders should look for some   before a further move higher. Traders should watch for some consolidation above trendline and R1 support at $8.38 before the stock potentially makes another move higher. If the stock rebounds from those levels, traders could see a move toward R2 resistance at $9.19 or a long-term retest of reaction highs at $12.50. If the stock breaks back below support, traders should watch for the next key support level at trendline and   levels near $7.52.

A gain of 13.52% in 2019 for shares of Google   Alphabet Inc. ( ) tells a story of a stock gaining alongside a large amount of unusual trading activity. It's bullish activity because the shares are heading higher on increasing  , indicating that a buyer is involved. Over time, we've learned how stocks with a history of strong   tend to rise in price. Smart money managers are always looking to bet on the next outlier stocks … the best in class. The main criteria we look for when betting on upside in a stock is a history of strong fundamentals, strong   and big potential buying in the shares. I'll go into the fundamental picture in a moment, but the true tell on the near-term trajectory of a stock lies in the trading activity of the shares. Simply put, it's all about supply and demand. When demand is higher than supply, the stock rises. When demand is lower than supply, stocks fall. For the second half of 2018, Alphabet stock was in a steady downtrend. Coming out of the meltdown in the market in late 2018, shares have retraced with unusual  . In our view, pullbacks = opportunities, especially pullbacks we see as mechanical in nature. For Mapsignals, when we look for an entry in a leading stock, we want to see an increase of potential buying. Just to show you graphically what our unusual trading activity signals look like, have a look at all of the unusual institutional (UI) signals Alphabet stock has made over the past year. Clearly, there was a lot of red in the back half of 2018. Alphabet is a popular  , and its shares fell alongside all stocks toward the end of last year. No stocks were immune to the massive sell-off in the market. The message is clear – shares move based on supply and demand. What is really catching our eye now is the recent UI buying: In 2019, Alphabet stock has logged six unusually high-volume days, indicative of buying in the shares starting on Jan. 31, 2019 (see chart above). This points to Alphabet gaining in an unusual way, which suggests that demand for the stock is increasing. If you are going to make a bet on the direction of a stock, it is prudent to pay attention to how the shares are trading. Just like you don't want to fight the trend, you also don't want to fight a stock that shows increasing price alongside an increase in the volume traded. Someone could potentially be accumulating a position. Mapsignals' goal is to identify tomorrow's top stocks today. We're basically looking for outlier companies with healthy fundamentals accompanied by outsized unusual institutional trading activity. By studying these data points, we can make an educated guess as to which equities institutions are trafficking in and marry this information with fundamentally sound companies. We want the odds on our side when looking for the highest-quality stocks. When we decide on a strong candidate, we consider prior leaders that have a history of technical outperformance. When they show leadership, we see these as opportunities. The following are a few areas in which Alphabet stock has grabbed our attention: Now, we take it a step further and score the best stocks showing unusual trading activity. These are the outliers. Below you can see the historical times since 2013 when Alphabet made the top 20 report for Mapsignals. These are the highest-rated signals in our stock universe. Clearly, we caught the big run-up over the past five years. That's exactly what our process is designed to do. We'd even venture to call this stock an outlier: On top of a technical picture that is strong, one should also look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Alphabet's latest earnings report showed year-over-year (YoY) growth: Alphabet stock is breaking out with other FANG names. We believe that the current stock price is in position for further upside. The narrative for Alphabet is that the company dominates search and the ad space. We are always on the lookout for great companies showing usual trading activity in their shares. The best companies tend to trend higher over the long run. All of this points to a long-term opportunity for the stock. Alphabet stock represents a potential buying opportunity for the long-term investor. Given the lift in price, historical fundamental outperformance and recent unusual buying signals, this stock could be worth a spot in a growth-oriented portfolio.

Dow component Apple Inc. ( ) traded above the 200-day   (EMA) for the first time since November on Tuesday, but the healthy bounce off December's 20-month low could end soon, trapping newly minted shareholders in a steep decline that fills the Jan. 30   between $155 and $160. Timely   taken during this period could offer opportune profits ahead of the company's first quarter earnings release on April 30. The stock has risen more than 28% since December, booking a year's worth of gains in less than three months. Intermediate technical readings have surged into   levels during this period, raising the odds for a downturn that relinquishes a big chunk of 2019 upside. More importantly, a decline that reaches last year's low would complete a   topping pattern that could signal the end of the multi-year uptrend. The stock topped out at a   $2.62 in 1991, following a multi-year uptrend. That level contained the upside until a 1999 breakout reached $5.37 at the turn of the millennium, marking the highest high for the next five years. The stock turned sharply lower when the internet bubble burst, bounced under a buck at the end of 2000 and tested that trading floor repeatedly into the second quarter of 2003. Committed buyers then took control, generating an uptrend that completed a round trip into the 1999 high in February 2005. The stock broke out immediately, entering a trend advance that posted impressive gains during the last half of the mid-decade bull market. The rally stalled near $30 at the start of 2008, giving way to a downturn that held 2006   during the economic collapse.  This resilience underpinned a strong recovery wave that reached the 2008 high at the end of 2009, yielding an immediate breakout to new highs. Upside continued into the 2012 high at $100.75, yielding a pullback that found support at the 50-month EMA. The moving average also ended the decline into 2016 as well as last year's sell-off, raising the odds that the stock will eventually reach new highs. However, price action still hasn't carved a higher low, which is needed to build long-term support. The monthly   fell into the oversold zone in 2009, 2013, 2016 and 2018, and crossed into buy cycles that matched strong bounces. However, the stock tested moving average support for at least five months in 2009, 2013 and 2016, exposing the current advance to a multi-week decline that shakes out  . That may happen soon because the weekly indicator has now reached the overbought zone. A   stretched across the uptrend that started in 2016 places the December low at the .618 retracement level, while current action has reached the .382 retracement. This level also marks the .382 sell-off retracement, while both levels have narrowly aligned with the declining 200-day EMA. This potent combination predicts that the current uptick will end in the $180s, ahead of selling pressure that targets the unfilled January gap at the .50 retracement level near $160. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator hit a new high in 2012, while the subsequent distribution wave ended in 2013. OBV has traded within those boundaries for the past six years, reflecting a tightly managed security with deep institutional support. The indicator fell to a two-year low in December, while the bounce into March has recouped about half of last year's deficit. This reflects a relatively benign technical condition in the early stages of new accumulation. Traders interested in playing the downside should wait for a reversal at the 200-day EMA. A subsequent decline to $175 will wave a red flag, but a breakdown at the horizontal 50-day EMA is needed to issue a more potent   that forecasts a swift decline toward $155. It may be wise to reverse positions if that target is reached because long-term relative strength cycles predict that Apple stock will eventually resume its upward trajectory. Apple's bounce off the December low could end soon, generating 15% to 20% downside that rewards timely short sales.

A decision by JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( ) in August last year to unveil an investment app offering all customers up to 100 free stock or   (ETF) trades in their first year, along with unlimited trades to Chase Private Client customers, was arguably the catalyst that started a six-month downtrend into   territory for several major investment brokerage stocks. In an industry already besieged with growing compliance costs and slow-moving  , investors began to question how brokerage firms would reinvent themselves to generate revenue in a shrinking fee environment. Ironically, offering heavily discounted   may be one of the most effective ways to go about it. It allows brokerages to onboard new customers to whom they can on-sell other more complex products, such as specialist financial advice or  . "What this is all about is JPMorgan's way of growing their customer base," said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets,  . "If they can attract new customers with this type of product, and then cross-sell into those customers other, more profitable products, they come out ahead," he added. From a   standpoint, these three investment brokerage stalwarts sit at crucial   that offers swing traders a high-probability entry point. Let's take a closer look at each stock. Chicago-based CME Group Inc. ( ) operates exchanges that facilitate trading in futures and derivatives. It covers asset classes such as interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, energy, metals and commodities. The company recently announced that the Dutch finance ministry grated approval for it to operate its new trading platforms, BrokerTec and EBS, in Amsterdam to avoid disruption to customers from  . Trading at $170.37, with a   of $60.96 billion and   1.74%, the stock is down 9.04% year to date (YTD), underperforming the financial exchanges industry average by 3.39% as of March 13, 2019. CME Group's share price has traded in a choppy   since mid-November last year that has provided both long and short trading opportunities. The bears have taken control of the stock in March and pushed price toward the descending channel's lower trendline – a key support area. Traders who take a position here should place a   near the pattern's upper trendline at the $182 level. Set a stop below the late-September   to protect trading capital. With a $58.63 billion market cap, The Charles Schwab Corporation ( ), provides brokerage, banking and asset management services. The company runs its brokerage business through a network of physical locations as well as through an online investing platform. Charles Schwab surpassed the Street's   fourth quarter projections due to higher interest margins and an uptick in trading activity over the period. Analysts have a 12-month   on the stock at $51.28 – 17% above Tuesday's $43.99 closing price. As of March 13, 2019, Charles Schwab stock pays a 1.54% dividend yield and has a YTD return of 6.33%. Although Charles Schwab's share price has failed to break above a long-term   line extending back to May 2018, it appears to be in the process of forming the right shoulder of an   pattern – a bottoming formation. More recent price action shows the stock holding a key support level at $44. Those who buy the pullback should look for a move back toward $48 – an area where the price may encounter   from the 200-day   (SMA) and a trendline that connects the November and January swing highs. Cut losses if the stock falls below $43, as this invalidates the setup. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation ( ) provides securities brokerage and advisor services to retail investors and traders as well as to independent   (RIAs). The Omaha-based brokerage firm generates the majority of its income from commissions and from asset-based revenue, such as interest on   and portfolio management services. TD Ameritrade is becoming an income investor's stock of choice – investors receive a   of 2.20%, which compares the investment bank industry's average yield of just 0.97%. Moreover, the company has a record of hiking its dividend. It has increased five times on a   (YoY) basis over the past five years for an average annual jump of 15.10%. TD Ameritrade stock has a market cap of $30.55 billion and is the best performer of the three stocks discussed with a YTD return of 11.97% as of March 13, 2019. TD Ameritrade's share price also looks to be forming a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern. The stock has recently retraced to the $54 level, where it finds a   of support from the 200-day SMA and a horizontal line that connects a series of prices over the past six months. The buy case also gains further conviction with the 50-day SMA crossing above the 200-day SMA in Tuesday's trading session, in what is known as a " " by technical analysts – a signal indicating that a new uptrend has commenced. Traders should set an initial target price near $58 and look for a possible test of the early June 2018 high if the price continues upward. Think about positioning a   just below $53.

Ulta Beauty, Inc. ( ), a major retailer of prestige cosmetics, reports quarterly earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, March 14. The stock closed Tuesday, March 12, at $311.41, up 27.2% so far in 2019 and in bull market territory at 38.8% above its Christmas Eve low of $224.43. The stock is just 3.4% below its all-time intraday high of $322.48 set on Nov. 19. Ulta is clearly a play on momentum, as the stock has an elevated   of 30.91 and does not offer a  , according to Macrotrends. The stock has a 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow   above 80.00, which makes it  . Shares of Ulta are above my annual pivot of $308.40, which is the key level to hold following earnings. If there is a positive reaction to earnings, a new high is likely, as my monthly and semiannual risky levels are $326.66 and $332.64, respectively. Analysts expect Ulta to report   (EPS) of $3.55 when the company releases results on Thursday. The cosmetics retailer has beaten EPS estimates in three consecutive quarters and in 17 out of the past 20 quarters. Wall Street expects solid growth in online and in-store sales. Ulta stock has been above a " " since May 11, 2018, when the 50-day   rose above the 200-day simple moving to indicate that higher prices lay ahead. This positive signal tracked the stock to its 2018 high of $322.49 on Nov. 19. The stock plunged 30% from this high to its Dec. 24 low of $224.43. Despite this bear market, buyers could have added to positions at its 200-day simple moving average at $252.43 on Dec. 10. The close of $244.84 on Dec. 31 was the input to my proprietary analytics and resulted in my quarterly value level at $241.02, my annual pivot at $308.40 and my semiannual risky level at $332.64. My quarterly value level held as a buying opportunity on the first two days of 2019. The close of $312.49 on Feb. 28 was also an input to my analytics and resulted in my monthly risky level at $326.66. My weekly risky level is $319.18. The weekly chart for Ulta is positive but overbought, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $300.87. The stock is above its 200-week simple moving average, or " " at $232.93. Investors could have bought the stock at this average when it was $224.95 and the stock set its low of $224.43. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to end this week at 87.70, up from 85.40 on March 8. On a positive reaction to earnings, this reading could rise above 90.00, making Ulta an "inflating parabolic bubble." Buy Ulta shares on weakness to my annual pivot at $308.40 and reduce holdings on strength to my monthly and semiannual risky levels at $326.66 and $332.64, respectively. My weekly risky level can be a sell level for more aggressive trading. My value levels and risky levels are based upon the last nine weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes. The first set of levels is based upon the closes on Dec. 31. The original quarterly, semiannual and annual levels remain in play. The weekly level is changed each week, and the monthly level was changed at the end of January and February. My theory is that nine years of closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price  , investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before the time horizon expires. My choice of using 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon   many methods of reading share price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years. The stochastic reading covers the most recent 12 weeks of highs, lows and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading, and I found that the slow reading worked the best. The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00, with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered  . Recently, I noted that stocks tend to peak and decline 10% to 20% and more shortly after a reading rises above 90.00, so I call that an "inflating parabolic bubble," as a bubble always pops. I also refer to a stock with a reading below 10.00 as "too cheap to ignore."

The rising popularity of   has opened up the ability for retail investors to easily invest in niche market segments such as data and infrastructure. In today's tech-focused world, reliance on businesses that generate majority of their revenue from real estate operations in the data and infrastructure sector is strong, and it will likely continue to grow over the decades to come. In this article, we'll take a look at a few charts from across the sector and try to determine how some may look to position themselves for a continued uptrend. A small and relatively under-followed ETF that is used by active traders for analyzing movements of the data and infrastructure real estate sector is the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate Sector ETF ( ). Taking a look at the chart below, you can see that the bulls have sent the price above a key level of resistance on rising levels of  . The price action over the past couple of trading sessions (shown by the blue circle) suggests that the bulls are in control of the momentum. Since the fund is relatively new to the market, you can see that there are now just enough data points to form the 200-day  . The bullish   between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages at $25.43 is a technical sign of the beginning of a long-term uptrend, and followers of technical analysis could use this level as a guide for placing  . Other traders who are more risk averse may want to set their stop-losses near the   at $26 shown by the short-term trendline. One of the market leaders in the real estate sector related to data and infrastructure is Equinix, Inc. ( ). With a   of nearly $37 billion, there are few other players that offer the breadth of services related to connecting businesses with   strategies via major interconnected data centers. Taking a look at the chart below, you can see that the bulls sent the price above a key trendline earlier in the week, shown by the blue circle. The bullish price action clearly shows that the bulls are in control of the momentum, and many active traders will likely set their target prices near the 2017 highs around $480. From a   perspective, stop-loss orders will most likely be placed below $404.15 in case of a sudden shift in sentiment. American Tower Corporation ( ) is the largest holding of the SRVR ETF, with a weighting of nearly 16%. With a market cap of $82 billion, it is also looked to as a barometer for the sector and provides targeted exposure to approximately 171,000 communication sites. Taking a look at the chart below, you can see that the stock is trading within one of the strongest uptrends found anywhere in the public markets, with little signs of slowing down any time soon. Active traders who following   theory may want to wait for a pullback toward the   of the 50-day moving average. Buying on weakness has proven to be a reliable strategy for followers of American Tower over the past few years and will likely be the go-to strategy moving forward. The reliance on real estate related to data and infrastructure makes SRVR an interesting ETF to add to any trader's watchlist. Furthermore, while the SRVR fund is under-followed, the chart patterns discussed above suggest that the sector is worth a closer look, and some of the top holdings such as Equinix and American Tower could be a good place to start.

Despite a strong rebound from its fourth-quarter low, the   opened trading on Tuesday still 5.2% below the all-time record high set last September. "We think there is more downside in this  ," says Morgan Stanley. "We believe that our call for a boom/bust almost 3 years ago is well advanced. Many investors underappreciated how markets in 2017 were discounting 2018's coming boom and failed to see how markets in 2018 would discount the oncoming bust of 2019." That's the sobering analysis of Morgan Stanley's U.S. equity   team, led by Michael Wilson, in their most recent Weekly Warm Up report. They expect the S&P 500 to fall to 2,600 in 2019, and perhaps even lower. That would be a decline of at least 6.7% from today's open, and a steeper 11.6% drop from September's high. (See table below.) (3 Recent Corrections in S&P 500 Index) With corporate earnings forecasts dropping, Morgan Stanley believes that stocks are "modestly  " now. However, the firm adds, "with earnings likely to fall another 4-5 percent, we think there is more downside in this correction." Rising costs are a major factor in this gloomy outlook for earnings. "The tax cuts enacted in late 2017 likely caused the   to tighten more quickly than they would have otherwise and also caused the US economy to overheat. This overheating created excesses in both the labor market and   that now need to be wrung out of corporate costs," the report observes. This has had a broader, negative impact. "Evidence of this cost rationalization is starting to show up in the data. Last week's jobs report was disappointing with one of the weakest payrolls numbers and the highest wage cost reading since the economic recovery began in 2009. Job cut announcements also spiked last week to the highest reading since July 2015. Finally, Amazon[.com Inc. ( )] reportedly stopped ordering product from many of its wholesale vendors, perhaps as a sign they are trying to reduce inventory costs," Morgan Stanley elaborates. The report's conclusion is simply this: the correction is not over until   pressures stabilize. Meanwhile, the authors also predict that other negatives are likely to emerge, including cutbacks in " , which we think is the next major area of disappointment." The combination of rising business confidence and tax cuts led to a surge of capital investment in 2017 and the first half of 2018, but "this created excess in the short term." Technology companies, particularly software vendors, were notable beneficiaries of the spending boom, the report notes. Morgan Stanley also observes that stocks which initially drop on lowered   have tended to rebound several days later, a worrisome sign. "We think this kind of 'dip buying' on guidance signals confidence in a  , but we aren't as sure," they say. Morgan Stanley has been ahead of many firms on   in forecasting the sharp fall in earnings in 2019, giving their observations particular weight. "  are likely to resume leadership," they say.

The iShares Dow Jones US Real Estate Index Fund ETF ( ) has been running in place in a narrow range pattern since topping out in 2015, paying out healthy   while awaiting more favorable business and interest rate conditions. However, top   (REIT) performers have shaken off this lethargy, posting new highs by taking advantage of hot local markets and/or favorable industry sub-groups. It's a relatively simple task to find these superior plays by sorting a list of fund components by relative positioning compared to the 200-day   (EMA).

The subsequent recovery wave completed a round trip into the prior high in 2013, but a breakout failed, reinforcing   in the mid-teens. A 2016 breakout attempt also failed, but price action finally reached an all-time high in January 2019. The REIT eased into a   pattern in February, absorbing overbought technical conditions after the breakout, and it has now bounced to range resistance at $18.60.

It sold off to $51.12 in 2016, while price action into this year has been contained within those boundaries. A 2015 bounce stalled at $73.05, while 2016 and 2017 rallies failed to pierce that stubborn resistance level.

Top-tier REITs are trading at or near new highs, perfectly positioned for long-side exposure.

Despite starting off the year strong, energy stocks have lagged the broader market rally over the last month. Now, some market watchers are becoming more bearish on the underperforming sector. They say that investors are likely to trim positions in individual energy stocks as well as ETFs such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ), which tracks the industry's biggest players, including Exxon Mobil Corp. ( ), Chevron Corp. ( ), Occidental Petroleum Corp. ( ), Marathon Oil Corp. ( ), ConocoPhillips ( ), Schlumberger Limited ( ) and Valero Energy Corp. ( ). "I think we're going to see energy sold, and that money is going to rotate into other areas where there's more momentum in the market," said Piper Jaffray's Craig Johnson, per a story in  . Johnston says investors should reduce their exposure to the XLE energy ETF. (Piper Jaffray Says Trim XLE ETF Stocks) The XLE suffered a nearly 4% loss last week, its worst weekly performance of the year. While the index is still up more than 13% year-to-date (YTD), versus the S&P 500’s 11.5% return over the same period, Johnson views the comeback as a “relief rally,” or a temporary break in selling, arguing that the sector's recent gains aren’t tied to underlying strength. BK Asset Management’s Boris Schlossberg echoed the downbeat sentiment on energy, suggesting that energy’s fate is now directly tied to a potential trade deal with China. “I think the XLE story is really the China oil story at this point,” said Schlossberg, warning that “an unwind of the China trade story” would be disastrous for the XLE. Not all are so bearish. Countering the pessimistic view on energy is JPMorgan's global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy Marko Kolanovic, who says energy is one group that may surprise and rebound, per  . “If the trade war is resolved, we could see another market-wide leg up, and energy could catch up,” said the quant strategist. He said that market technicals look positive for energy players, noting that if oil moves up $5 a barrel on a trade deal, “that would go a long way to change positioning.”

Momo Inc. ( ) shares rose 12% during Tuesday's session after the Chinese mobile platform reported better-than-expected fourth quarter financial results. Revenue rose 44.7% to $559.1 million, beating consensus estimates by $22.65 million, and earnings per share came in at 59 cents, beating consensus estimates by seven cents per share.   also rose from 99.1 million to 113.3 million, while paying users rose from 7.8 million to 13 million. The stock is trading more than 30% off of its 52-week high, but it rallied more than 60% from its 52-week low made in December 2018 following its third quarter earnings report. Morgan Stanley downgraded Momo stock to Equal Weight from Overweight and reduced its   from $61.00 to $30.00 following the third quarter financial results. Momo's management is meeting with JPMorgan and Benchmark analysts following the fourth quarter results, which could lead to bullish forecasts. From a technical standpoint, Momo stock reached the top of its bullish price channel following Q4 earnings, but it remains below key 200-day moving average and trendline  . The   (RSI) is moving toward overbought levels at 65.17, while the   (MACD) could see a near-term bearish crossover. These indicators suggest that the stock could give up some ground before breaking out from key resistance. Traders should watch for some   below trendline resistance at around $38.00 over the near term, with strong   near the   at $32.32. If the stock breaks out from trendline resistance, traders could see a move toward R2 resistance at $39.71. If the stock breaks down from trendline support, traders could see a move to the 50-day moving average at around $30.00 or S1 support at around $20.00.

Exuberant stock investors are embracing risk again as they scoop up equities with weak   quality, just a few months after stocks fell within a hair of a bear market. This group of riskier stocks, surprisingly, has posted average gains of 18% through the first two months of 2019, dramatically higher than the average 13% gain of higher-quality stocks with more stable earnings, according to a recent study of 1,200 stocks by Bank of America. Some of the top performers come from the communications, energy and utilities sectors, according to a detailed story in the  . (performance in first 2 months of 2019) Source: Bank of America, per WSJ The return to riskier stocks has partly been driven by the Federal Reserve’s more   stance as it holds off on further rate increases for the time being. Growing optimism about trade negotiations between the U.S. and China is also playing a role. Bank of America defines these risker stocks as ones with weaker earnings quality and stability. The risk is that low-quality stocks tend to be sold off first when markets turn   as investors seek safer investments. That happened during the fourth-quarter sell-off and also when stocks pulled back last week. The riskiness of low-quality stocks lies not only in unreliable earnings or even losses, but they often have higher debt burdens, according to the Journal. These weaknesses emerge when the economy deteriorates or slips into a recession. "With the market starting to give back some of the gains, higher-quality companies are going to come back in vogue,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told the Journal. He added, "They’re not the swiftest of boats, but they’re the most buoyant.”" Many low-quality stocks include high-growth internet stocks, media companies and telecom companies in the communications sector, says Bank of America analyst Jill Carey Hall. Internet companies Facebook Inc. ( ) and Netflix Inc. ( ), video game company Electronic Arts Inc. ( ), and television services provider Dish Network Corp. ( ) have blown ahead of the market this year with year-to-date gains of 32%, 33%, 24% and 30%, respectively. While riskier stocks have rallied from the late 2018 selloff, the exuberance is unlikely to last as a number of macro risks still loom over the U.S. and global economy. “We’re seeing and expecting higher   around these macro events and quality stocks are where you would want to position yourself,” said Bank of America's Carey Hall.

The aging 10-year bull market, which barely escaped plunging into a bear market decline in December, is on precarious footing even as it's been prolonged by a new, dovish Fed policy. "For now, the bull marches precariously on," says Goldman Sachs. "Tactically, we forecast S&P 500 returns will be modest in the near-term." Goldman highlighted a host of reasons why the forces that drove stocks in the past decade are unlikely to be repeated soon, and why the S&P 500 will struggle to rise in 2019, per the table below. With the 10th anniversary of the current bull market upon us, Goldman cites its historically high returns, with a total gain of 401% (17.5% annualized), which ranks in the 94th percentile of 10-year annualized returns since 1880. But as economic growth decelerates and upside becomes more limited, Goldman expects the stock market's momentum to slow significantly. Apple Inc. ( ) is one stark example. Goldman says the company was a major driver of the S&P 500 and accounted for 20 percentage points of the index's total return over the past decade. But it's unlikely to be a key driver in the next decade. Its sales have stalled and the stock has gone sideways in the past month. The iPhone maker is one of 10 stocks that accounted for 25% of the S&P 500’s return over the past 10 years. Stocks also face mounting pressures from wage inflation and other input costs that will pressure margins, making further expansion from the current record-high margins unlikely. Squeezed margins are one reason that valuations, which are dramatically higher than ten years ago, have limited upside. Goldman notes that the aggregate S&P 500 forward P/E multiple has expanded from 10x to 16x (+58%) this cycle. Perhaps the most important destabilizing influence is earnings. Goldman says that earnings growth accounted for nearly 75% of the S&P 500's gains during the 10-year market expansion. But now, profit growth is evaporating and may even decline in some quarters in 2019, a number of market forecasters say. All of this bodes poorly for stocks. "The positive impact on equity valuations from a patient Fed unlikely to tighten the funds rate for the rest of the year is offset by the negative impact of an anticipated recession in 1Q aggregate S&P 500 EPS,” wrote Goldman. All of these factors contribute to the firm’s target of 2,750 for the S&P 500 by mid-year, roughly unchanged from today. To be sure, Goldman's forecast for the S&P 500 at 3,000 by year-end still implies a major 20.6% gain from the end of 2018, which is robust growth. But the market has shot up so far so fast ahead of fundamentals that it's now vulnerable to a pullback. Or in a best case scenario, it's set to post only modest gains for the rest of the year.

Dow component Verizon Communications Inc. ( ) has been running in place since October 2018 but now looks set to test 1999's all-time high in the mid-$60s. Nearly six years of sideways action in the $50s raises the odds for a powerful breakout, opening the door to impressive returns for long-term shareholders. More importantly, low   should make it easy for sidelined investors to jump on board at favorable prices.  since the start of 2018 reflects the communication giant's narrow domestic focus at a time when American blue chips are losing revenues and customers due to trade wars and growing geopolitical tensions. This   status should boost future revenues despite worries about slowing smartphone sales, while the repeal of net neutrality allows Verizon to build internet pricing power, unencumbered by governmental prohibitions. The stock broke out above three-year   in the upper teens in 1989, entering a long-term uptrend that stalled in the mid-$30s in 1996. A pullback to the 50-month   (EMA) got bought for the fifth time in six years, generating a parabolic rally impulse that continued into October 1999's all-time high at $64.00. Sellers then took control, grinding out a steep downtrend that accelerated into a seven-year low in the mid-$20s in 2002. A bounce into 2003 got sold in the low $40s, marking resistance that stalled progress until a 2007 breakout failed to attract buying interest, reversing less than two points above new  . The stock held a trading floor near $30 into September 2008 and broke down, dumping to a 16-year low during the October crash. That deep print finally ended the nine-year downtrend, yielding a recovery wave that completed a round trip into the 2007 high in 2012. A 2013 breakout stalled at $54.31, kicking off a range-bound period that has persisted for nearly six years. The stock has gained ground slowly within this pattern, tracking a rising highs trendline that is now targeting the 1999 high. An October 2018 breakout above the 2016 high at $57 also mounted the .786  , clearing a major harmonic barrier, but the monthly   has been stuck in a bearish cycle since December. The October 2018 rally cleared two-year resistance, lifting the stock to an 18-year high, but the uptick stalled well below 1999's all-time high. Selling pressure tested new support in December and January, while a bounce into February stalled at the 50-day EMA about two weeks ago. A buying spike above $57.61 should attract short-term interest in this price structure, bringing the red trendline and 2018 high into play. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator topped out in 2013 and entered an aggressive distribution phase that continued into the seven-year low in July 2017. Buying pressure since that time has covered three-quarters of the distance back to the prior high, marking a modest deficit that should close during a test at long-term resistance. It's wise to keep close watch on OBV in the coming weeks because an upswing could presage a rapid price advance. The monthly stochastics oscillator is pointed lower and not cooperating with this bullish scenario, advising patience as long as price holds the 200-day EMA, now rising from $54.50. It may take a rally above the red line to generate a bullish  , aligning major technicals in favor of an advance into multi-decade resistance. A positive feedback loop could develop quickly once that happens, with buying waves triggering a historic breakout. Verizon stock is inching closer to a historic test at 1999's all-time high in the mid-$60s. Bullish   action in recent years favors a breakout, opening the door to the $70s and $80s.

American luggage and handbag design retailer Vera Bradley, Inc ( ) is solidly in recovery mode, up 21.5% so far in 2019 and in bull market territory at 31.1% above its Dec. 27 low of $7.94.

On June 6, the retailer beat analysts' earnings estimates, and the stock headed higher. On Sept. 5, another earnings beat caused a   higher and led to the Sept. 10 high of $17.38. The shares slumped significantly from the high, and an earnings miss on Dec. 12 propelled the stock to its Dec. 27 low. Vera Bradley stock has a reasonable   of 14.22 according to Macrotrends. The daily chart for Vera Bradley clearly shows the bear market decline of 54% from the Sept. 10 to the Dec. 27 low. Since the low, the stock has had a steady rise, and the high at $10.48 on Monday, March 11, was a new 2019 high. The stock suffered a " " on Dec. 10, when the 50-day   crossed below the 200-day simple moving average to indicate that lower prices would follow. This signal was in play at the Dec. 27 low. The close of $8.57 on Dec. 31 was an important input to my proprietary analytics, which resulted in my quarterly pivot at $9.86. The close of $9.55 on Feb. 28 was the latest input to my analytics and resulted in my monthly value level at $9.08. The stock is above its 50-day simple moving average at $9.32 and below its 200-day simple moving average at $12.33. The weekly chart for Vera Bradley is positive, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $9.79 and below its 200-week simple moving average, or " ," at $12.14.

The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow   is projected to end this week rising to 60.96, down from 47.72 on March 8. Buy Vera Bradley shares on weakness to my quarterly pivot at $9.86 and to my monthly value level at $9.08, and reduce holdings on strength to the 200-week and 200-day simple moving averages at $12.14 and $12.33, respectively.

Dow component International Business Machines Corporation ( ) posted a horrific negative 26% return in 2018 but has gained nearly 19% so far in 2019. Unfortunately, that has fostered complacency among newly minted shareholders who don't realize that the multi-year downtrend remains in full force. Even worse, the bounce since December has lifted into a price level that could offer outstanding gains for aggressive  . So far at least, the bounce in IBM shares has failed to end the unbroken string of lower highs and lower lows in place since the March 2013 top. In addition, the stock has just reversed at 50-week   (EMA) resistance, after failing to reach 200-week EMA resistance, exposing structural weakness. Meanwhile, long-term   readings continue a buy cycle that began in January 2019, delaying a downturn that could test the 2018 low. A multi-year rally topped out at a   $43.69 in 1987, giving way to a persistent downtrend that finally bottomed out near $10 in 1994. It took four years for the subsequent bounce to reach the prior decade's high, generating an immediate breakout that developed strong momentum into the 1999 high at $138.35. That marked the highest high for the next 11 years, ahead of a broad topping pattern that broke to the downside in 2002. Selling pressure ended in the mid-$50s a few months later, yielding weak upside into 2007, when a healthy uptick surged toward the 1999 high. The stock stalled nine points under that   in 2008 and got pummeled during the economic collapse, giving up more than two years of gains in less than four months before finding   in the $60s. The November low marked a historic buying opportunity, ahead of a rapid recovery that reached the 2008 high in December 2009. A 2010 breakout generated widespread interest, lifting the stock nearly 80 points into the 2013 all-time high at $205.90. It broke down from a   pattern six months later, entering a brutal downtrend that gathered momentum into 2016's six-year low at $116.90. It bounced to $180 a year later and turned tail once again, carving the second lower high since the 2013 peak. The subsequent decline held support near $140 through most of 2018, finally breaking down in October, ahead of December's nine-year low. The sell-off into 2016 found support at the .618   level of the four-year uptrend, which had narrowly aligned with the 200-month EMA. It pierced that level and the moving average in late 2018 before remounting both obstacles into March 2019. However, it has now dropped through the moving average once again, reinforcing new resistance while opening the door to continued downside that could easily reach the .786 retracement level at $100. Three-year price action looks like a   above the 1999 high (green line), which has narrowly aligned with the 200-month EMA. The bounce into March has reversed at this new barrier, telling market players that the multi-year downtrend could resume at any time and drop the stock to new lows. Even so, the monthly buy cycle isn't fully cooperating yet, raising the odds that upside will continue into the red or blue line. A Fibonacci grid stretched across the downtrend shows that the current advance still hasn't reached the .382 retracement, exposing hidden weakness. The next rally burst could lift the stock into the red   of lower highs, the October breakdown and the closely aligned .382 retracement level, offering a potential short sale. However, a bearish   should generate the most reliable entry signal in the coming weeks, regardless of the underlying price level. IBM stock is approaching major resistance after a strong bounce off multi-year lows and could generate profitable short sales for positions held into the third quarter of 2019.

The four "too big to fail"   are Bank of America Corporation ( ), Citigroup Inc. ( ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( ) and Wells Fargo & Company ( ). Data for the fourth quarter of 2018 from the   (FDIC) suggest that these banks, which control 40% of the assets in the banking system, should not be core holdings in your investment portfolio. My focus in this analysis is the FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile for the fourth quarter of 2018. I view this data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as the   for the U.S. economy. My focus on FDIC data began in 2006 as the   was inflating. Back then, I warned that there would be 500 bank failures when the bubble began to pop. We know that the homebuilder stocks peaked in mid-2005, community banks peaked in December 2016 and the regional banks including the money center banks peaked in early 2007. My conclusion since the end of 2007 is that residual issues remain in the banking system, and now new issues are coming into focus. FDIC Chair Jelena McWilliams reported that the fourth quarter was strong for the banking system. Despite the positives, there remain issues that need to be monitored. McWilliams made the following cautious comments: The following is a scorecard of the key metrics I track: The number of FDIC-insured financial institutions fell to 5,406 in the fourth quarter, down from 5,477 in the third quarter. At the end of 2007, there were 8,533 banks. The number of employees in the banking system decreased to 2.067 million in the fourth quarter, down 6.7% since the end of 2007.

This loan category is down 44.4% below the level at the end of 2007.  represents second lien loans to homeowners who borrow against the equity of their homes. Regional banks typically offer   (HELOCs), but these loans continue to decline quarter over quarter despite the dramatic rise in home prices.

Dow component The Boeing Company ( ) was trading nearly 10% lower ahead of Monday's opening bell after the Ethiopian crash of the new 737 Max 8 airliner, marking the second fatal incident in less than five months. China responded by grounding all Max 8s, and other groundings are likely to follow, affecting the market leader's 2019 profits and revenues. Taken together with persistent selling pressure since March 1, the stock may have topped out for this economic cycle. The company had 330 Max aircraft ready for service at the end of 2018 as part of a multi-year roll-out to replace the 737 New Generation (NG) series. The 737 has been wildly popular since its introduction in 1967, and any controversy that affects   could have a major impact on future earnings. It's especially dangerous in China, where the bad news for Boeing will likely improve sales and government sponsorship of the locally manufactured Comac C919. Boeing stock posted an all-time high at $446 on March 1 after gaining more than 34% following December's decline to a 52-week low. It was set to open Monday at a six-week low near the 50-day   (EMA) at $375, but that   may not contain short-term damage, given the months required to investigate the Ethiopian crash. Deteriorating sentiment could weigh heavily on buying interest during this time, setting the stage for a steep decline that traps remaining shareholders. A two-year downtrend ended at $16.07 in the fourth quarter of 1992, giving way to an uptick that reached new highs in 1995. The stock continued to post gains into 1997, finally reversing at $60.50 and losing 50% of its value in the next 15 months. The subsequent recovery wave mounted the 1997 high in 2000, but momentum failed to develop, generating a new high at $67, followed by a steep downturn that failed the breakout after the Sept. 11 attacks. Selling pressure eased at an eight-year low in the mid-$20s in 2003, ahead of a strong uptick that posted impressive gains throughout the mid-decade bull market. Boeing shares broke out to a new high in 2005 and kept on going, rallying into the triple digits in 2007. The stock turned tail in 2008, dropping in an aggressive decline that accelerated during the economic collapse. The downtrend finally ended in 2009 at a horizontal support line (red line) in place for more than 10 years. It took more than four years for the subsequent bounce to complete a round trip into the 2007 high, yielding an immediate breakout that stalled above $144. The stock tested new support for another three years, finally turning higher in a powerful trend advance following the 2016 presidential election. The rally continued into the March 2018 high at $371, ahead of a tough 2018  , and broke out to a new high once again in February 2019. A   stretched across the uptrend that started in December 2018 places this morning's open below the .382 retracement level at $388 and within the Jan. 30 continuation  . This is a dangerous spot because it favors a rapid gap fill that drops the stock another 12 to 15 points into the .50 retracement level. In turn, that downdraft would generate a major   at the January breakout level, with a decline through $365 setting off another round of sell signals. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator topped out in February 2018 and posted a lower high when the stock hit a new high in October. It bounced back to this level and reversed with price on March 1, reinforcing a bearish   that could now power the downside. The low $300s are exposed in this bearish scenario, telling sidelined market players to keep their powder dry for now. Boeing stock was set to gap down more than 40 points on Monday morning, marking the next stage of a decline that could signal a long-term top.

Cronos Group Inc. ( ) shares fell more than 2% on Monday morning after BMO Capital downgraded the stock from Market Perform to Underperform. The analyst cited a production ramp that is behind other licensed producers and a potentially "elevated"   as a rationale for the downgrade. Melius Research analysts also initiated coverage on Cronos stock with a Neutral rating and a C$27.00   last week. The downgrade comes shortly after Altria Group, Inc. ( ) closed its $1.8 billion investment in Cronos announced earlier this year. The investment provides Altria Group with a 45% economic and voting interest in the licensed producer, along with a warrant to acquire additional ownership at C$19.00 per share to bring its total stake to 55%. Altria Group also nominated four directors to serve on Cronos Group's board. From a technical standpoint, Cronos stock moved to the lower end of its price channel following the analyst downgrade. The   (RSI) moved to neutral levels of around 51.29, but the   (MACD) remains in a bearish downtrend that began in mid-February. These technical indicators suggest that the stock could see more downside ahead before regaining ground from a technical standpoint. Traders should watch for a breakdown from trendline   at $20.80 toward the 50-day moving average and S1 support at $18.54 or a rebound higher toward upper trendline   at about $24.00. If the stock breaks down from S1 support levels, the next area of strong resistance is trendline and S2 support at $15.44. If the stock breaks out from trendline resistance, traders could see a move toward R2 resistance at $28.20 on the upside, although that scenario appears unlikely.
A gain of 27.14% in 2019 for shares of Facebook, Inc. ( ) tells a story of a stock gaining alongside a large amount of unusual trading activity. It's bullish activity because the shares are heading higher on increasing  , indicating that a buyer is involved. In  , I discussed how institutional selling was slowing in Facebook shares. Over time, we've learned how stocks with a history of strong fundamentals tend to rise in price. Smart money managers are always looking to bet on the next outlier stocks … the best in class. The main criteria we look for when betting on upside in a stock are a history of strong  , strong   and big potential buying in the shares. I'll go into the fundamental picture in a moment, but the true tell on the near-term trajectory of a stock lies in the trading activity of the shares. Simply put, it's all about supply and demand. When demand is higher than supply, the stock rises. When demand is lower than supply, stocks fall. For the second half of 2018, Facebook stock was in a steady downtrend. Coming out of the meltdown in the market in late 2018, shares have outperformed with unusual  . In our view, pullbacks = opportunities, especially pullbacks we see as mechanical in nature. For Mapsignals, when we look for an entry in a leading stock, we want to see an increase of potential buying. Just to show you graphically what our unusual trading activity signals look like, have a look at all of the unusual institutional (UI) signals Facebook stock has made over the past year. Clearly, there was a lot of red in the back half of 2018. Facebook shares came under pressure after the company   lower and alerted investors to a data breach. Wall Street priced in this information, and the stock reflected this by heading lower on big volumes. The message is clear – shares move based on supply and demand. What is really catching our eye now is the recent UI buying: In 2019, Facebook stock has logged three unusually high-volume days, indicative of buying in the shares starting on Jan. 31, 2019 (see chart above). This points to Facebook gaining in an unusual way, which suggests that demand for the stock is increasing. If you are going to make a bet on the direction of a stock, it is prudent to pay attention to how the shares are trading. Just like you don't want to fight the trend, you also don't want to fight a stock that shows increasing price alongside an increase in the volume traded. Someone could potentially be accumulating a position. Mapsignals' goal is to identify tomorrow's top stocks today. We're basically looking for outlier companies with healthy fundamentals accompanied by outsized unusual institutional trading activity. By studying these data points, we can make an educated guess as to which equities institutions are trafficking in and marry this information with fundamentally sound companies. We want the odds on our side when looking for the highest-quality stocks. When we decide on a strong candidate, we consider prior leaders that have a history of technical outperformance. When they show leadership, we see these as opportunities. The following are a few areas where Facebook stock has grabbed our attention: Now, we take it a step further and score the best stocks showing unusual trading activity. These are the outliers. Below you can see the historical times since 2013 when Facebook made the top 20 report for Mapsignals. These are the highest-rated signals in our stock universe. Clearly, we caught the big run-up over the past five years. That's exactly what our process is designed to do. We'd even venture to call this stock an outlier: On top of a technical picture that is strong, one should also look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Facebook's latest earnings report showed year-over-year (YoY) growth: Facebook stock is breaking out with other high-quality tech names. We believe that the current stock price is in position for further upside. The narrative for Facebook is that the company has stumbled and will rise again. We are always on the lookout for great companies showing usual trading activity in their shares. The best companies tend to trend higher over the long run. All of this points to a long-term opportunity for the stock. Facebook stock represents a potential buying opportunity for the long-term investor. Given the lift in price, historical fundamental outperformance and recent unusual buying signals, this stock could be worth a spot in a growth-oriented portfolio.

Bullish sentiment about stocks is waning rapidly. Among leading fund managers across the globe, 34% believe that the   is past its peak, spurring them to reduce their exposure to U.S. equities to the lowest levels since the middle of last year while increasing their cash to levels last seen during the depths of the   a decade ago, per the latest release of the monthly Global Fund Manager Survey from  . Deteriorating   are a big driver of the increasingly bearish sentiment. "Earnings revisions have been some of the worst we've ever observed in terms of breadth and velocity," as Mark Wilson, chief U.S. equity   at JPMorgan, observed in a recent note to clients, as quoted in a detailed story in the  . Meanwhile, the National Association for   reports that more than 75% of its 281 members surveyed recently expect a   to begin in the U.S. before the end of 2021, the FT adds. Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies, observes that being bullish right now can be a bad career decision for investment managers. With mounting indicators that the risk for stocks is skewing to the downside, he suggests that the safest course career-wise is to go   and possibly leave some gains on the table, rather than stay bullish and chance piling up big losses if the market does indeed tumble. “The clients [i.e., investment managers] themselves point out that their biggest problem is career risk. If indeed the U.S. does have a recession and they didn’t make any asset allocation toward defensiveness and taking money off the table, it would be such a big problem for them with their own clients," Darby told the FT. One of the biggest bears is Peter Cecchini, chief global strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, who sees the S&P 500 tumbling to 2,390, for a 13.6% drop from the March 7, 2019 open, per BI. He also anticipates that the U.S. and China will resolve their issues, but he believes that the U.S. nonetheless will slip into a recession in 2020, further driving down corporate earnings and valuations. Among the larger firms, another bear is Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo. He predicts the S&P 500 sinking to 2,665, or 3.7% below the March 7 open. However, he may revise his figure upward, largely based on the   turn by the  . "We do see pretty good things right here, and we do see the fundamentals quite solid," he told  , also stating, "We probably shouldn't be as risk-averse as we were before." Nonetheless, some bulls are holding their ground. "We think it's a secular bull [market]," as Linda Duessel, senior equity strategist at Federated Investors, told the newspaper. Federated believes that the U.S. economic expansion can last another two decades, buoyed by continued low inflation and low interest rates. "We feel very good that we're not going to fall into a recession. The economy has shown resilience but also rejuvenation. People are coming back and looking for jobs," said David Bianco,   for the Americas at the DWS asset management unit of Deutsche Bank, told the FT. The current U.S. expansion began in June 2009, per the  . Bianco cites recent precedents of 16 years of growth in the U.K. and 27 years in Australia to illustrate his view that the U.S. expansion is not apt to die simply of old age. Binky Chadha, the chief global strategist at Deutsche Bank, is currently the most bullish voice among strategists at major firms, according to  . He predicts that the S&P 500 will reach 3,250 this year, for a gain of 17.5% from the March 7, 2019 open, and 10.5% above the previous record high set in Sept. 2018. He also does not anticipate a recession in the near future, expects an end to the U.S.-China trade war, and predicts that resolution of these fears will spur a rebound in stock market  . Stating the obvious, eventually the U.S. economic expansion and the bull market must end, but no one can be sure exactly when. With global economic growth decelerating, the onset of a recession in the U.S. probably is coming closer, and investors would do well to prepare.

A short list of consumer stocks is uniquely positioned to outperform the market as consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, remains strong. Even as the economy slows, sales in 2019 should grow of 4%, excluding gasoline and autos, while e-commerce sales could rise 15% for the 10th straight year, according to  . Jefferies favors mostly inexpensive, overlooked stocks such as Capri Holdings Ltd. ( ), YETI Holdings Inc. ( ), Planet Fitness Inc. ( ), Acushnet Holdings Corp. ( ), and also higher-profile Under Armour Inc. ( ), as outlined in  . “The group is cheap, under-owned, and Amazon.com is not a threat,” analyst Randal Konik said. And William Blair, for its part, recommends four consumer stocks that are likely to outperform over the next 60 days, including Lululemon Athletica Inc. ( ), Fox Factory Holding Corp. ( ), At Home Group Inc. ( ) and Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. ( ), all of the firm expects to post outsized returns in the upcoming months, per another   story. In a recent note, Jefferies analyst Konik urged investors to “get out of overpriced food and staples stocks and BUY RETAIL,” which he views as undervalued. He said that investor fears are overblown that weak holiday sales indicate a poor 2019.. Konik’s “top longs” include golf ball company Acushnet Holdings and Versace owner Capri Holdings. Similarly, William Blair selected stocks for its “consumer near-term focus list,” which focuses on stocks expected to rise sharply within two months. William Blair likes shares of athleisure market leader Lululemon, which have already beaten the market significantly, rising over 82% in 12 months and 21.6% YTD through Thursday morning. Analysts expect strong results and upward earnings revisions in the short-term and long-term to provide upside for shares and pave the way for valuation expansion. “Lululemon has an enviable competitive position with a powerful combination of highly productive stores, aspirational proprietary product, a healthy e-commerce channel, and the potential to still more than double revenue as the concept continues to expand around the globe,” wrote William Blair. Also within the fitness realm, Jefferies likes Planet Fitness, a franchisor and operator of fitness centers that has seen its stock more than quadruple since its IPO in 2015. Positive drivers for these consumer stocks aside, it’s important to note that even these companies’ profits and stock prices may perform poorly if the economy downshifts too rapidly. They are also vulnerable to a rise in the unemployment rate, which has stayed at historical lows.

Costco Wholesale Corporation ( ) stock rallied more than 4% to a three-month high in Thursday's post-market after the company beat fiscal second quarter profit estimates by 32 cents and reported in line revenues. Revenues rose 7.3% year over year, while quarterly   missed estimates, lifting 5.4%. The retailer also reported mediocre February comps, rising just 3.5%. The stock barely budged overnight, setting the stage for a bullish open despite broad market weakness. The off-hours rally has filled the Dec. 12   between $219 and $225, and the stock is holding near the top of the big hole ahead of the opening bell. This is considered a neutral zone, signifying   when filled slowly but marking a bullish change of character when a gap fills the gap. Early price action should dictate which side is in control, with a rapid thrust into the $230s or a reversal that targets gap   under $220. A multi-year uptrend ended in the low $20s in 1992, yielding a decline into the single digits one year later. The stock turned higher in 1995, entering a trend advance that reached the prior high in the fourth quarter of 1997. A 1998 breakout gathered momentum, topping out at $60.50 in the second quarter of 2000. Aggressive sellers then took control, dumping price more than 50% in less than two months. A bounce into 2001 failed in the $40s, yielding a   at the 2000 low at the start of 2003. That marked a buying opportunity, ahead of a steady uptick that posted impressive gains throughout the mid-decade bull market. Costco stock broke out above the 2000 high in July 2007, added 15 points into May 2008 and turned sharply lower during the economic collapse, bottoming out in March 2009 at a four-year low in the upper $30s. That marked the lowest low in the past decade, yielding a strong bounce that completed a 100%   into the 2008 high in early 2011. It broke out a few months later, entering a powerful advance that carved new highs into 2015.  surged between 2015 and 2018, but price action held close to a rising highs trendline (upper red line), setting the stage for a breakout above that resistance level in June 2018. The rally stalled in September, yielding a December breakdown that trapped bulls in a steep decline that reached a six-month low at $189 at year end. This morning's uptick may have cleared that barrier, opening the door to greater short-term upside. The monthly   entered a sell cycle in October 2018 and crossed over in March, just below the indicator panel's midpoint. This marks the shortest sell cycle since 2013, while the buy cycle after that   lasted just three months, suggesting that market players should remain cautious despite the bullish turn of events. In turn, that shines a bright light on short-term price action that needs to mount resistance in the $220s or risk a major reversal. A   grid stretched across the uptrend leg that started in July 2017 places the December reversal near the 50% retracement, while subsequent action has generated new support at the .382 retracement level near $210. The stock has now remounted the 50- and 200-day   (EMAs), establishing a second support layer near $215. Given this morning's strong action, a pullback into that level should now mark a low-risk buying opportunity. On the upside, the Fibonacci sell-off grid highlights the .618 level at $224, marking support that bulls need to hold into the weekend. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator broke out above 2008 resistance in the second half of 2018, posting an all-time high in November. Selling pressure into December barely registers, indicating loyal sponsorship that should support a rally to new highs. The indicator could reach the 2018 high ahead of price in Thursday's regular session, generating a bullish divergence that predicts price will eventually play catch-up. Costco stock is trading higher after an upbeat quarterly report and could hit new bull market highs in the coming months.

Apparel and accessories retailer American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. ( ) has been   a bear market decline of 43% from its Aug. 22 high of $29.89 to its Dec. 24 low of $17.00. The stock closed Tuesday, March 5, at $20.43, up 5.7% so far in 2019 and up a bull market rise of 20.2% since trading at its Dec. 24 low. Even so, the stock remains in bear market territory at 31.6% below its Aug. 22 high. The retailer sells apparel and accessories to both men and women, as well as personal care products for women. American Eagle's body-friendly Aerie brand is taking   from Victoria Secret. Analysts expect American Eagle to post   (EPS) of 42 cents when it reports results after the closing bell on Wednesday, Feb. 6. The retailer reported better-than-expected EPS for three consecutive quarters. Wall Street is looking for a year-over-year decline in revenue, so   will be important. Guidance will include American Eagle's digital channel and  , including foot traffic. The retailer's stock is reasonably priced with a   of 13.40 and a   of 2.76%, according to Macrotrends. The daily chart for America Eagle shows the bear market decline from the Aug. 22 high to the Dec. 24 low. Note the price   lower on Aug. 29 on a negative reaction to earnings. The earnings report on Dec. 11 was a factor leading to the Dec. 24 low. The close of $19.33 on Dec. 26 was an important input to my proprietary analytics, which resulted in my annual value level of $19.19 and my semiannual and quarterly pivots at $20.92 and $21.68, respectively. The close of $20.40 on Feb. 28 was the latest input to my analytics and resulted in my monthly pivot at $21.46. The stock is below its 200-day   at $22.54. The weekly chart for American Eagle is positive, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $20.50 and above its 200-week simple moving average, or " ," at $17.28. Note how the stock could have been bought at its "reversion to the mean" at $17.08 at the end of 2018. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow   is projected to end this week rising to 67.97, up from 64.96 on March 1. Buy American Eagle shares on weakness to my annual value level at $19.19 and to the 200-week simple moving average at $17.28, and reduce holdings on strength to the 200-day simple moving average at $22.54. My semiannual, monthly and quarterly pivots are $20.92, $21.46 and $21.69, respectively.

Tesla, Inc. ( ) shares fell more than 4% during Tuesday's session before finding some footing on Wednesday. Chinese customs put a brief hold on 1,600 Model 3 vehicles due to a lack of proper labeling on Tuesday, underscoring some of the risks associated with trade tensions. The news also comes as the company is nearing completion of its Shanghai manufacturing plant at a time when NIO Inc. ( ) scrapped its own plans for a new electric vehicle (EV) plant, citing concerns about China's new EV subsidy policy and weaker demand for electric SUVs in early 2019. Investors have also been concerned about talks of Tesla requiring a capital raise over the coming months if business conditions don't improve, as well as CEO Elon Musk's ongoing legal troubles with the   (SEC). The company's second largest stakeholder suggested that the investment firm wouldn't be against having Elon Musk in a non-CEO role if the SEC were to take action to remove him from the role. From a technical standpoint, the stock moved toward the low end of its bearish price channel over the past few sessions. The   (RSI) moved toward oversold levels of 36.36, but the   (MACD) recently experienced a bearish crossover. These indicators suggest that the stock could see a brief reprieve before resuming a trend lower, absent of new bullish developments. Traders should watch for   above S2 support at $275.49 over the near term. If the stock breaks down from these levels, it could retest reaction lows at the bottom of its price channel near $250.00. If the stock rebounds higher, traders should watch for a move toward S1 support at $297.69. There's heavy resistance at the  , 50- and 200-day moving averages, and trendline resistance at around $310.00.

The   (SOX) bounced strongly off December's 16-month low in January and February but has now reversed at a key   level that's notorious for printing lower highs within long-term topping patterns. This bearish action waves a red flag for the broad swath of chip stocks, warning shareholders to tighten stops and/or take profits because a deeper slide is possible in the coming weeks. The index fell to a three-week low on Wednesday, cutting through the 20-day   (SMA) for the first time since Jan. 4. The downdraft has dumped the weekly   into the first sell cycle in more than two months, predicting at least six to eight weeks of relative weakness. Taken together with the reversal, it looks like the sector's oversold technicals have now eased out of the system, eliminating the tailwind that underpinned first quarter gains. Micron Technology, Inc. ( ) and NVIDIA Corporation ( ) declines fueled Wednesday's rout, but bigger names are at risk as well in coming weeks. Intel Corporation ( ) has reversed within 25 cents of harmonic  , but weekly stochastics needs further weakness to generate a sell cycle, telling market players to watch the reaction to Broadcom Inc. ( ) earnings next week. That stock reversed within one point of the November 2017 high about two weeks ago. The index joined U.S. exchanges above 200 in 1994, entering an immediate uptrend that reversed near 570 in 1995. The subsequent downturn posted an all-time low at 139 in 1996 and tested that level in 1998, carving a   reversal ahead of a parabolic buying impulse that continued into March 2000's historic peak at 1,362. It completed a broad topping pattern in October and broke down, spiraling lower for the next two years. Selling pressure eased less than 60 points above 1998   after relinquishing more than 1,000 upside points, while the subsequent bounce stalled near 550 in January 2004. Breakout attempts in 2006 and 2007 failed, giving way to a decline that accelerated during the 2008 economic collapse, dropping the index to a 12-year low at 177. That vertical impulse finally ended the eight-year downtrend, ahead of a powerful recovery that completed a round trip into the 2004 resistance level in 2014. A breakout into 2015 failed to develop momentum, yielding repeated testing that completed a   reversal in 2016. The subsequent uptick posted a new high in July and took off in a healthy uptrend that continued into January 2018, when the advance reached long-term resistance at the 2000 high.   surged into March while price posted an all-time high at 1,465 and eased into a   that broke to the downside in October. The sell-off into year end violated 50-week   (EMA) support for the first time since 2016, hitting a 16-month low at the .382 Fibonacci retracement level of the uptrend that started in 2015. The index turned higher into the first quarter of 2019 and reversed at the .786 Fibonacci sell-off retracement level in February, warning that a test of the 2018 low will complete the next leg of a potential long-term topping pattern. The 1,270 level has set up as an important price zone, marked by the breakout above fourth quarter resistance as well as the narrowly aligned 50- and 200-day EMAs. Three-month price action has carved unfilled   near 1,300 and 1,200, exposing a decline in excess of 10% below the most recent close. Market tone may then dictate the outcome of this progressive pattern, with a bounce yielding a more complex trading range, while a decline through 1,100 would set the stage for a major downtrend. The PHLX Semiconductor Index has reversed at the .786 retracement of the 2018 decline, which started after a reversal at 19-year resistance. This bearish combination could be potent, presaging a topping pattern and the start of a multi-year downtrend.

CVS Health Corporation ( ) shares fell more than 1.2% on Thursday, breaking down from key channel  . Since the health services company reported fourth quarter financial results on Feb. 19, the stock has plunged nearly 24% to fresh 52-week lows. Investors remain concerned about the stability of the company's existing businesses, as well as the integration of Aetna following the acquisition. Earlier this week, Citi analysts lowered their   on CVS shares from $94.00 to $68.00, but they maintained a Buy rating. The analyst says that retail headwinds are significant, but he's most surprised by the significant drop in the health care benefits segment. He admits that it's difficult to gain visibility into 2020 but sees a "reasonable path" to $7.20 in   next year, justifying his current rating. These sentiments mirrored those of other analysts that weighed in earlier. While analysts have downgraded CVS stock due to the uncertainty, management remains confident that the headwinds are temporary. CEO Larry Merlo called 2019 a "year of transition" as the company integrates Aetna and focuses on its growth strategy over the long term, but he remains confident in the company's longer-term success. From a technical standpoint, CVS stock experienced a   at the end of last year and a   in late January. These bearish trends accelerated following the company's fourth quarter financial results. On Thursday, the stock broke down from trendline support at the bottom of its price channel. The   (RSI) moved deeper into oversold territory at 20.08, but the   (MACD) remains very bearish. Traders should watch for some   around trendline and S1 support near $53.50. If the stock breaks down from these levels, traders could see a move lower toward S2 support at $49.14. If the stock rebounds from these levels, traders could see a move higher to retest the   at $61.90 over time. The current bearish sentiment in the market suggests that the bull case may still be a ways off.

Snap Inc. ( ) stock jumped 22% after the company beat fourth quarter profit and revenue estimates in early February, and it has added another 17% into March, lifting to a six-month high in the double digits. However, the rally has now reached   that could end the upside and drop the stock into a test of the 2018 low posted in December. Given this technical hurdle, shareholders may wish to tighten stops or take profits to preserve windfall gains. The company is booking more revenue per user, but daily average users (DAUs) failed to grow in the fourth quarter while declining 0.3% year over year, ahead of a highly touted redesign of Snap's Android interface. The company offered no first quarter DAU   but was "cautiously optimistic" that there would be no sequential decline. Given the 43% buying spree in the shares since those mixed metrics, it's likely that the stock is now fully valued. Raymond James upgraded the messaging giant after the quarterly release, but other Wall Street firms weren't as impressed by the results or forward guidance. Deutsche Bank lowered its   on Snap to $10.00 while maintaining a Hold rating, concerned about user growth and engagement, while JPMorgan and Needham reiterated sub-par ratings on the stock. This lack of enthusiasm suggests that   money has fueled the recent rally rather than   participation. The company came public at $24 in March 2017 and posted an all-time high at $29.44 in the following session. It then turned tail, cutting through the IPO opening print and dropping into the upper teens. Price action held that   for three months and broke down, selling off to $11.28 in August 2017. A six-month   pattern at that level yielded a February 2018 breakout that ran into a buzzsaw of selling pressure, topping out at $21.22 after a single session. The stock drifted lower into April 2018, filling the breakout  , and trapped overeager bulls when it cut through nine-month support a few days later. A June test at new resistance allowed aggressive   to reload positions, ahead of a brutal 67% decline into December's all-time low at $4.82. Snap stock has more than doubled in price since that time, returning to the price level traded in September.  The rally has now reached 50-week   (EMA) resistance at $10, which also corresponds to the 200-day EMA, and is quickly approaching resistance at the September breakdown (red lines). Meanwhile, the weekly   lifted into the overbought zone for the third time in the stock's two-year history in January 2019, well ahead of the February rally wave. It has now crossed over but will not issue a sell signal until the lead line cuts through the 80% level. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator posted an all-time high during February 2018's one-day wonder rally and entered an aggressive distribution phase that hit an all-time low in December. Buying pressure since that time has failed to reach the level of the September breakdown, lowering the odds that price action will mount that barrier forcefully in the coming weeks.  grids stretched across selling waves since February 2018 place current action near the .382 retracement of the 10-month downtrend and .618 retracement of the selling wave that started in June. These levels narrowly align with September resistance, establishing a formidable barrier that is likely to generate a pullback or resumption of the long-term downtrend. The big unfilled gap situated between $7.00 and $8.20 looks like a magnetic target in this price structure, raising the odds for a deep slide that traps complacent bulls. Snap stock has gained more than 40% in the past month, lifting into tough resistance that is now likely to generate a multi-week decline.

Apparel and accessories retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( ) reported better-than expected earnings before the opening bell this morning. The stock   higher and reached and exceeded my quarterly risky level, now a pivot at $24.92. If you made an earnings bet, consider reducing holdings now! Before earnings, Abercrombie shares were already in bull market territory. The stock closed Tuesday, March 5, at $21.35, up 6.5% so far in 2019 and in bull market territory at 39.7% above its Nov. 20 low of $15.28. This solid recovery continues, but beware that current strength is a   of a bear market decline of 48.5% from its 2018 high of $29.69 set on Aug. 14. Back on Aug. 30, the stock gapped lower on a negative reaction to earnings, which leaves a price gap to its Aug. 29 low of $25.99. Technicians say that price gaps are almost always filled. The specialty retailer offers apparel and accessories for all members of the family. Some brands focus on the younger crowd – those between 21 and 24 years of age. The Hollister brand targets the teen market with endless summer stylings. In addition to having stores around the world, Abercrombie has an active e-commerce strategy. Analysts expected Abercrombie report   (EPS) of $1.15 when the retailer released results before the opening bell this morning. The company beat estimates by 20 cents, posting EPS of $1.35. Abercrombie now has a seven-quarter winning streak in terms of beating EPS estimates. The daily chart for Abercrombie shows how volatile this stock can be in reaction to earnings. Notice the price gap lower following earnings reported on Aug. 30. Then, on Nov. 29, the stock gapped higher in reaction to earnings, which set the stage for the bear market rally for the stock. Abercrombie shares closed Dec. 31 at $20.05, which was an important input to my proprietary analytics. This resulted in my quarterly risky level, now a pivot at $24.92. The close of $21.95 on Feb. 28 was another input to my proprietary analytics and generated my monthly value level at $18.34. The weekly chart for Abercrombie is positive but  , with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $21.75 and above its 200-week  , or "reversion to the mean," at $19.51. This average was last tested during the week of Jan. 18. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow   is projected to end the week at 80.80, just above the overbought threshold of 80.00. Buy Abercrombie shares on weakness to the 200-week simple moving average at $19.49 and to my monthly value level at $18.34, and reduce holdings on strength to my quarterly risky level at $24.92. The next sell level is the price gap to the Aug. 29 low of $25.99.

The 2019 stock rally is being fueled by two largely overlooked catalysts: a 58% increase in   and a 5-fold rise of inflows into   in the last week alone, per data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Strikingly, this is happening as   alike have been net sellers of shares, illustrated by $1.48 billion in single-stock sales in the week ending March 1, according to a detailed story in   . This is a source of concern for at least one stock market strategist. "The fund flows show you that, while we've had a solid recovery off the Dec. 24 lows, the participation rate--both institutionally and by retail investors--has not been there," said Art Hogan, chief   at National Securities, per CNBC. "You're seeing this V-shaped recovery in markets and yet positioning is still very light," he added, while also cautioning, "There is a feeling the market is running out of steam." The table below outlines the key forces pushing stocks up. (A look at the week ending March 1, 2019) Though the   is up by 11.3% thus far in 2019 through the open on March 6, Hogan believes that many investors are still rattled by the sharp sell-off that occurred in December. "The short-term muscle memory of how quickly things collapsed is still there, even though some of the things that caused it have reversed," he said. Nonetheless, even though investors are becoming more hesitant about owning individual stocks, the rush into ETFs has been brisk. For the entire month of February, U.S.-listed ETFs enjoyed net inflows of $22 billion, swelling their total assets to $3.75 trillion, according to  . To meet the brisk demand,  , or the issuance of new ETF shares, by U.S. equity ETFs were valued at more than $13 billion in February. For ETFs investing in international stocks, net creations were about $1 billion, while the figure was $9 billion for fixed income ETFs. Share repurchases by the issuing corporations have been a leading source of demand for stocks throughout the current bull market, and thus a principal driver of stock market gains. Since 2009, stock buybacks have totaled about $5 trillion, adding roughly 2% to the annualized growth rate in  , according to analysis by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity strategy at JPMorgan, per  . He calculates that S&P 500 share repurchases announced in 2018 were about $938 billion, almost double the 2017 figure. Repatriations of overseas cash were approximately $570 billion across the first three quarters of 2018. Lakos-Bujas expects that S&P 500 companies will announce about $800 billion of buybacks this year, funded mainly with cash reserves rather than with debt. He notes that U.S. corporations still hold about $1 trillion cash overseas, and anticipates that they will repatriate large sums again in 2019. Much of that is likely to flow into buybacks, further bolstering stock prices.

Even as growth stocks have soared this year as the bull market rallied, many investors are buying seemingly unexciting, payout-rich dividend stocks. Income-oriented equities such Abbvie Inc. ( ), Broadcom Ltd. ( ), SL Green Realty Corp. ( ), Regions Financial Corp. ( ), Phillips 66 ( ), Marathon Petroleum Corp. ( ), T. Rowe Price Group Inc. ( ), PNC Financial Services Group ( ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( ) and Comerica Inc. ( ) are among the best positioned to outperform amid low inflation, political uncertainty and a dovish Federal Reserve, per  . “In a world of slow economic growth and political uncertainty, we’re trying to find ways to generate returns,” said David Carter, chief investment officer at wealth-management firm Lenox Wealth Advisors, in a story in  . “We’re actually buying a lot more dividend stocks now.” See the table below for a look at these stocks' track record. Many investors are unaware that dividends accounted for 19% of the returns in the S&P 500 during the past five years, per Morningstar Inc. in the Journal, or that dividend stocks frequently perform better than non-dividend equities longer term. More striking, during the six decades through 2018, the top 20% of S&P 500 stocks by dividend yield and weighted by market cap led the broader S&P 500 by 2.13 percentage points yearly, per Greenrock Research. Barron’s looked at stocks with dividend yields above 3%, all which ranked in Realty Shares’ top category for dividend safety. In analyzing dividend safety, the index provider looked at seven factors including earnings growth over the past 12 months, a company’s dividend actions over five years, the ratio of cash spent on stock buybacks versus dividends, and how much free cash is available to cover dividend payments. Drug company Abbvie was the highest-yielding on the list, yet its shares remain in bear market territory. Broadcom, which boasts a 3.9% dividend yield, is the only tech company on the list. While investors fear a slowdown in the cyclical semiconductor industry, the chipmaker has seen its shares gain 11.5% over 12 months. The company is slated to report quarterly results on March 14. The attractiveness of dividend-paying stocks may demonstrate that many investors remain cautious and fundamentally unimpressed by the euphoria of the market rebound this year. Instead, it appear that they are both on the lookout for short-term pitfalls and also selecting stocks for longterm outperformance.

After a strong start to 2019, many investors are looking for segments of the market that could protect capital from a significant  . While some are choosing to reduce their exposure to equities, others may want to consider a position in some of the largest companies as a way to mitigate the impact of a sell-off. In the paragraphs below, we'll take a look at several   to determine how active traders will be looking to position themselves over the weeks or months ahead. As you may know, the   comprises the 500 leading companies from across the United States and represents approximately 80% coverage of available  . It is widely regarded as one of the best gauges for large-cap U.S. equities and is often added to portfolios of investors seeking exposure to the U.S. While many investors want broad exposure to the entire U.S. stock market, some prefer to buy into a subset of the top 50 companies for the purposes of gaining exposure to limit downside risk and in many cases generate consistent and attractive  . One common exchange-traded product for buying into this niche segment of   is the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF ( ). Fundamentally, the holdings carry an average market cap of nearly $356 billion, and the fund has a total   of 0.2%. Taking a look at the chart, you can see that the surge in momentum so far in 2019 has pushed the price of the fund above the   of its 200-day moving average (red line). The rise in price is now also in the process of testing the resistance of a horizontal trendline, which active traders will likely be keeping a close eye on. A close above the dotted resistance will likely act as a catalyst for a move back toward the 2018 high of $211.83. Another ETF that offers exposure to mega-cap companies that investors may want to consider is the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF ( ). Fundamentally, the fund comprises 262 holdings with a median market cap of $127 billion. With total net assets of $1.7 billion, MGC is one of the most popular ETFs in this segment, and as you can see from the chart below, the pattern looks nearly identical to the one for XLG shown above. Active traders will likely keep a close eye on the dotted trendline for determining the placement of any buy-stop orders. From a risk management perspective,   will most likely be placed below the 200-day moving average at $94.27 in case of a sudden pullback. Another related mega-cap ETF that could be worth consideration over the weeks ahead is the Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF ( ). For investors seeking exposure to the world's largest companies with a   lens, MGV is an interesting choice because it briefly rose above the dotted resistance of an influential trendline. The nearby support of the 200-day moving average will likely be used to determine the placement of stop-loss orders, and traders will likely set their targets near the high of $82.02.  As investors start to take a closer look at their portfolio allocation, it could prove prudent for many to shift some capital into the market's largest companies. Based on the charts above, traders will likely keep an eye on the nearby resistance of influential trendlines. Breaks above these levels could be the catalyst needed for a sharp rise back toward the 2018 highs and beyond.

General Electric Co’s ( ) stock this year has soared as high as 75% off its December lows as a rising number of analysts and investors have grown more positive about the company's outlook under its new CEO since October, H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. But much of Wall Street, nonetheless, has remained deeply skeptical about GE's outlook, illustrated by the stock's 10% pullback in the past week, part of it spurred by published reports in Barron's that earnings may be inflated in company's airplane leasing unit. That decline has shaved GE's gains since its December low to more than 50%. On Tuesday, CEO Larry Culp told investors that GE's 'industrial free cash flow', will be negative in 2019, after generating $4.5 billion in 2018. Shares fell 4.7% on the news. That's the short term. What's worse is that analysts are not optimistic the company will see much improvement in 2019 based on consensus estimates. For the year, analysts see earnings rising over 10% versus 2018’s dismal results, while revenue is forecast to fall by 6%.  It was not long ago, in 2017, that analysts were forecasting GE would earn more than $2.00 per share this year. That was during a different time and under different leadership. Now analysts forecast earnings of just $0.72 per share, a 65% decline from those 2017 highs. Additionally, those earnings estimates have dropped 17% since the start of 2019. It is not just earnings estimates that have declined. Revenue estimates have fallen by 4% to $114.71 billion this year. Part of the reason for the significant drop in revenue and earnings is that the company's series of asset sales, such as the recent   of its biotech business to Danaher Corp. ( ). CEO Culp is taking big steps to de-leverage the balance sheet, which is laden with $100 billion in long-term debt and nearly $34 billion in pension liabilities. When it comes to GE's stock, options trades and technical charts give dramatically opposing views of GE's future. The options are bearish while the technical charts are overwhelmingly bullish. Options trades project a sense of uncertainty regarding the direction of GE’s stock in 2019. It is so uncertain that the long straddle options strategy suggests that the equity rises or falls by as much as 32% from the $10 strike price by options expiration on January 17, 2020. It would place the shares in a trading range of $6.85 and $13.15 by the expiration date. However, the number of bets at the $10 strike price is minuscule with just 1,600 bullish open call contracts to just 3,600 bearish open put contracts. The dollar amounts are even smaller with the calls valued at less than $300,000 and the puts valued at approximately $450,000. It would suggest that traders have little confidence in the direction of GE’s stock and are unwilling to place large bets. The technical charts, by contrast, are unusually bullish and project the stock rising towards a technical downtrend, one that has been in place since May 2018. Should the stock rise above that downtrend, it could trigger a breakout that may send the stock higher towards $12.50 and perhaps as high as $14.25. Those are the next two technical resistance levels for the stock. Additionally, the relative strength index has been steadily trending higher in recent weeks, suggesting that bullish momentum is moving into the stock. However, the RSI is nearing overbought levels at nearly 70, and that would suggest that the stock may move lower in the short term before rising longterm. Despite that bullishness, CEO Culp and GE must overcome a pervasive pessimism stemming from the downfall of what once was one of Wall Street's most revered blue chip companies. Its shares fell by nearly two-thirds from their five-year high, inflicting tens of billions of dollars in losses on investors. The year 2019 is when Culp will have the opportunity to position GE for a recovery. But even with that, it could take years for GE to turn around its operations, share price, and recoup the trust it lost on Wall Street.

The Kroger Co. ( ), the largest U.S. grocery store chain, is on the cusp of a major breakout. And the technical charts are signaling that this could be a breakout higher. The grocery chain has been under pressure from increased competition. News last week about Amazon.com, Inc. ( ) launching another grocery store brand didn't help. However, Kroger has many competitive advantages over its competition, and it is a lead innovator in the grocery sector. The company has a trove of data on its consumers and their shopping habits. It has a three-part agenda going forward to utilize technology, automation and big data analytics to grow its operations. This innovation is what helped the stock break out of a long-term   in July of last year. Take a look: The red   marked the key highs during the downtrend. When those levels were broken in July, the stock began a new  . Now the stock has formed a new pattern. It has been trading in a narrowing   formation, where the   and   lines are closing in on each other. In the wedge pattern above, the red line acts as resistance, and the green line is support. Once shares break out of this formation, a big rally or decline will likely take place in quick fashion. The key sign of an upside breakout, though, is that the green support level has been tested four or five times, depending on where you draw the line. The resistance has been tested just twice, signaling that the support is stronger. It is also the longer lasting of the two trendlines, suggesting that shares will continue to climb. The height of the wedge pattern is $9. With the stock trading at around $29, this implies that a 30% move is about to take place for Kroger shares over the next few months. Kroger is set to report earnings on March 7, and we could see a double-digit move on that report alone. That will likely be the day Kroger stock breaks out of this wedge pattern, and it could be the start of a much larger uptrend for the stock. However, If Kroger stock fails to break out higher from this wedge pattern, the downtrend will take over and send stock below $20 per share in the coming months. Kroger stock is set to make a big move. Based on the stock's wedge pattern, I expect a 30% breakout to the upside in the coming months. Earnings on Thursday could be the start of that major rally.

Stock prices across the   have bounced strongly higher along with much of the broad market since notching 52-week lows back in December. While there has been much to cheer about so far in 2019, the first real test of   seems to be causing active traders to pause and take a closer look. In this article, we'll take a closer look at three charts suggesting that the move could be coming to an end and that the financial sector could be gearing up for a move lower. When it comes to tracking the financial sector, most traders turn to   such as the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( ). With total net assets of nearly $24 billion, there are few funds more widely followed by the active trading community. Taking a look at the chart below, you can see that the $27 level has acted as a strong psychological level of   and resistance over the past year. The sharp rise from the December low has now sent the price toward the resistance of its 200-day  , which seems to be causing the bulls to pause and consider whether they have enough conviction to overcome both of these strong levels of resistance. Followers of technical analysis may want to take note that the   (MACD) indicator has recently crossed below its signal line, which suggests that the momentum is starting to weaken, and this could be looked to as a leading indicator of a coming pullback. Bullish traders may want to remain on the sidelines for the next few trading sessions to see if the price is able to move above the combined resistance levels. A break above would likely be a catalyst for a move higher, but at this point, the odds look to be in favor of the bears. With a   of $228.5 billion, Wells Fargo & Company ( ) is one of the largest players in the financial sector and is often looked to as a barometer for how the sector is performing and set to perform in the future. Taking a look at the chart below, you can see that the 50-day moving average is below the 200-day moving average, which is one of the strongest indicators of a downtrend by those who follow technical analysis. As shown in the example of XLF above, the price of Wells Fargo stock is also nearing the psychological resistance of a key   near a major price level, which in this case is $50. The sideways price action over the past couple of weeks suggests that the conviction in the move higher is waning and that the bears could be readying to make a move to push the price lower. Another interesting chart that is catching the eye of active trader belongs to Citigroup Inc. ( ). As you can see below, the price of stock has recently tested the combined resistance of the 200-day moving average and two influential trendlines. The bearish   between the MACD indicator and its signal line combined with the prominence of nearby resistance seems to suggest that the bears are in the process of gaining control of the momentum and that prices could be set for a move lower over the coming weeks or months. The financial sector has benefited nicely from the strong bounce from December lows. However, given the move toward the combined resistance of 200-day moving average and influential trendlines, it seems as though the bulls may want to tread with caution. Based on the patterns discussed above, it appears as though the bears could be gaining control of the direction of the trend.

Trendy lifestyle retailer Urban Outfitters, Inc. ( ) is a retail   so far in 2019. The stock traded as low as $29.84 on Feb. 22 and is down 9% so far in 2019. The stock is also deep into bear market territory at 42.5% below its 2018 high of $52.50 set on Aug. 22. Even so, the stock is "too cheap to ignore" because its weekly slow   is below 10.00 on a scale of 00.00 to 100.00. In addition, the stock is above my monthly and annual value levels at $30.23 and $29.04, respectively. Analysts expect Urban Outfitters to post   (EPS) of 79 cents when the retailer reports earnings after the closing bell today, March 5. The stock has a reasonable   of 11.61, according to Macrotrends. The retailer has bettered analysts' EPS estimates in six consecutive quarters, but this is not reflected in the daily and weekly charts. Wall Street is projecting year-over-year gains in both earnings and revenue, and some analysts say that the retailer should benefit from refurbished stores and offering more assortments of lifestyle products. Urban Outfitters has also expanded its e-commerce activities. The daily chart for Urban Outfitters shows that the stock had a strong reaction to earnings released on Aug. 21, which resulted in the Aug. 22 high at $52.50. Investors used this strength to book profits. On Nov. 8, a " " formed when the 50-day   fell below the 200-day simple moving average, indicating that lower prices would follow.

This resulted in my annual and semiannual value levels at $29.04 and $26.71, respectively, and my quarterly risky level at $35.98. The stock closed at $30.85 on Feb. 28, which resulted in my monthly value level for March at $30.23.

The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading is expected to end this week at 6.87, well below the oversold threshold of 20.00 and below 10.00 as a stock that is "too cheap to ignore." A positive reaction to earnings should have the stock above the five-week modified moving average and the 200-week simple moving average. Buy Urban Outfitters shares on weakness to my annual and semiannual value levels at $29.04 and $26.71, respectively, and reduce holdings on strength to my quarterly risky level at $35.98. My monthly pivot at $30.23 is a key level at today's close – above it is positive, and below it is a warning.

Managed care stocks have come under heavy selling pressure since a "Medicare-for-All" bill was submitted to the House of Representatives by Rep. Pramila Jayapal on Wednesday, Feb. 27. The bill essentially proposes moving away from the current multi-payer system to a simplified government-funded single-payer system over a two-year transition period. Since the bill made its way into the House, the S&P 500 Managed Health Care subindex (^SP500-35102030) – a benchmark for stocks in the sector – has fallen 9.5% as of March 5, 2019. Although most analysts believe that the proposed bill has little chance of passing a Republican-controlled Senate, investors have been quick to offload shares in managed care stocks over fears that both parties may feel pressure to act on cutting health care costs ahead of 2020 election. "In our view, the bill has no chance of passing the [Republican]-controlled Senate and probably little chance even in the [Democrat]-controlled House given Speaker Pelosi's apparent ambivalence," JPMorgan Chase analyst Gary Taylor wrote in a note,  . From a chart perspective, leading stocks in the managed care sector have fallen toward key   levels, with indicators flashing short-term   conditions. Those who believe the sell-off is overdone should run their eyes over these three trading ideas. Humana Inc. ( ) specializes in providing government-sponsored plans, with the majority of its membership linked to health care programs such as   and Medicaid. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company exceeded analysts' fourth quarter earnings and revenue estimates and expects 2019 adjusted   (EPS) of between $17.00 and $17.50. Humana trades at 23.9 times earnings, slightly below the industry average   of 25.2. The stock, with a   of $37.64 billion and issuing a 0.70%  , is down 3.08% year to date (YTD) as of March 5, 2019. Humana shares sold off sharply in November and December but recovered roughly half of those losses in January. The stock then traded sideways for most of February until selling off again on the "Medicare-for-All" bill news in the later part of the month. Traders should look for an entry point at the $270 level, where the price is likely to encounter support from the early January swing low. Consider banking profits on a move back up to $310 – an area where the stock may run into   from several swing highs and the 200-day   (SMA). Protect trading capital by placing a   about 10 points below the entry price. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated ( ) provides   services to its individual, employer and government-sponsored members through insured and fee-based plans. The company's insurance business, UnitedHealthcare, reported fourth quarter revenue of $46.2 billion, up 11.1% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis.

Trading at $236.02, with a market cap of $226.47 billion and yielding 1.49%, UnitedHealth Group stock is down 1.19% YTD, underperforming the Health Care Plans industry average by about 1% as of March 5, 2019. The health insurer's share price has fallen away on above-average volume in recent trading sessions as traders digest the impact of possible government measures to curb health care costs. Despite the sell-off, the stock provides a   opportunity at the $233 level, where the price is likely to find support from December's swing low. The prospect of a bounce increases at this level given that the   (RSI) shows short-term oversold conditions with a reading below 30.0. Think about positioning a   near $270 – in the proximity of last month's high – and close losing trades if the stock pushes below $230.

Tesla, Inc. ( ) shares dropped nearly 40 points in two sessions after CEO Elon Musk advised that the controversial automaker wouldn't be profitable in the first quarter. He also hedged his prediction about second quarter earnings, stating that a profit appeared "likely" while announcing that worldwide sales would be shifted online. The CEO justified the action, insisting that cost savings from the transition will support a lower $35,000 sticker price for the troubled mass market Model 3. The controversial billionaire said nothing about the $940 million   payment due on March 1, but the profitability comment appears to be directed at this obligation, which was satisfied in cash according to The Wall Street Journal. The paper also reported that Tesla's coffers have shrunk by at least 25% due to the outlay, which was required because the stock price failed to hold at or above the $360 required by the debt contract. Musk's behavior is also back in the news, adding to shareholder anxiety, with the   (SEC) asking a judge to hold the CEO in contempt for violating the terms of his September agreement. Musk attacked his accusers following the court filing, but this watchdog agency is unlikely to be swayed by threats. Given the conflict, the legal drama could continue well into the second quarter, intensified by the departure of the company's general counsel after just two months. Legal experts believe that coming down hard on Musk will adversely affect shareholders because Tesla is closely identified with its controversial leader, and banning him from corporate life could drop the stock into a tailspin. However,   have already abandoned the company, dropping   readings back to levels first reached in 2013. Making matters worse, the stock price hasn't gained a penny in nearly two years. The stock broke out above two-year   in the mid-$30s in 2013, entering a momentum-fueled advance that stalled above $280 in 2014. It ground sideways for another two and a half years, finally ejecting higher in the first quarter of 2017. That buying impulse posted an all-time high at $386.99 just two months later, giving way to a volatile trading range that has tested range   at the 2017 breakout three times and range resistance at the 2017 high four times. The monthly   carved orderly waves between 2014 and 2017, crossing into a buy cycle in January 2018. It then eased into a shallow sideways pattern, reflecting this stock's mortal conflict between bulls and bears. The indicator lifted above the panel's midpoint and rolled over for the third time in December 2018, reflecting growing danger at the 50-month   (EMA), which is being tested for the third time since March 2018. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator pushed above the October 2017 high in June 2018 and turned sharply lower, dropping close to the 2016 low (red line) in October. It bounced to August levels in December and turned lower once again, showing no signs of accumulation in the first quarter of 2019. This loss of sponsorship is raising all sorts of red flags, warning that the stock may be close to breaking two-year range support near $250. A breakdown through the January low at $279.28 would initiate the third test at that level since March 2017. Tesla stock is trading at $285 ahead of Tuesday's opening bell after bouncing at $283 on Monday, March 4. Price action could hover around this level until the March 11 court hearing, but sustained buying pressure is unlikely until the latest SEC action is adjudicated. That could take time, given Musk's recent hiring of the attorney who prosecuted Enron Corporation in 2001. (See also:  .) Elon Musk has triggered another round of sleepless nights for long-suffering Tesla shareholders, warning that the company won't turn a profit in the first quarter while heading back to court on a contempt charge from the SEC.

The first quarter rally has stalled in the past week while market players await the final outcome of U.S.-China trade talks, but a basket of   leaders continues to post new highs. This makes sense, given the growing risk appetite following a 2018 decline that threatened to upend the decade-long bull market. However, positive small-cap   will dissipate in two months, giving way to a mid-year environment that often punishes small speculative issues. As a result, it makes sense to make hay while the sun shines, pressing positions while engaging in aggressive   and profit taking. This process works best when the technician identifies potential barriers before trade entry, uses   after entry and takes profits without hesitation when price action reaches those levels. Of course, this takes discipline because rising prices can induce absentmindedness that ignores major warning signs. These small-cap leaders have risen to the top of the   performance list as calculated by relative positioning above the 200-day   (EMA). That also means these stocks are probably overbought and setting off contrary signals, adding another reason that aggressive trade management is needed to book profits.   signals are particularly useful when dealing with this scenario, watching for bearish   that can precede downturns.  sells programmable logic and other semiconductor devices in Asia, Europe and the Americas.

Aurora Cannabis Inc. ( ) shares moved more than 3% lower during Monday's session after Cronos Group Inc. ( ) sold its stake in Whistler Medical Marijuana Aurora for C$175 million in stock.

While the analyst firm anticipates overcapacity issues in the future, Wertheimer notes that Aurora has taken measures to capture   while lowering production costs to preserve margins. The industry faces a lot of uncertainty at the moment. While Canada legalized adult use and medical cannabis last year, analysts are divided about whether the market will be oversupplied in the not-too-distant future. Scientists at the University of California Berkeley also successfully created cannabis compounds in a lab rather than harvesting them, which could open the door to alternative production methods. From a technical standpoint, the stock could be making a bearish   chart pattern. The price stands near the critical shoulder line, where a breakdown could signal the start of a prolonged downtrend. The   (RSI) appears neutral at 50.01, but the   (MACD) remains bearish. These indicators suggest that the stock could see some downside ahead. Traders should watch for a breakdown from the shoulder line at around $7.11 per share, which could lead to a move down to S1   at $6.70 or S2 support at $5.84. If the stock rebounds from these levels, traders should watch for a move to retest reaction highs of around $8.50, which would invalidate the bearish head and shoulders chart pattern.

Stock investors around the world could see significant gains in the wake of a potential U.S.-China trade deal as equities recoup much of the huge 10% discount they've traded at because of negative trade headlines, according to strategists at UBS Group AG. UBS estimates that the U.S.-China trade war has penalized the European STOXX 600 index by 12.5%, the S&P 500 index by 10.2%, the MSCI World by 9.5%, the Shanghai Composite by 9.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets by 6.4%, per  . (see table below). There is continued skepticism among many investors about the the strength and effectiveness of any trade agreement. But some analysts, for example, say U.S. stocks alone could rise nearly 11% higher. And JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Marko Kolanovic estimate that trade headlines have cost U.S. stocks $1.25 trillion in the form of lost market value. "Equities are still pricing relatively large trade discounts,” wrote UBS. “The probability of a near-term resolution is rising, and even if our model somewhat overstates the discount priced into equities, room remains for equities to rise on a further reduction in tensions.” (% Penalized) A Washington trade deal with Beijing could lift a majority, if not all, tariffs, on Chinese goods with the promise that China would follow through on various conditions, including more stringent intellectual property regulation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Responding to reports that an accord is near, Bank of America said that a "real deal" could push the S&P 500 up nearly 11% to a new record high of 3020. In a note last month, strategists estimated that a reversal in 2018 tariffs would boost U.S. corporations’ earnings per share growth by 1%. Not everyone is so bullish about a U.S.-China trade deal. In fact, some experts, including Shawn Matthews of Hondius Capital Management LP, say an agreement would be a "sell signal," per  . He views the rally in global stocks since December as sign that a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the fact” may materialize. Also, Citigroup analysts argue that there's only a 5% chance of a "comprehensive" deal that would sharply lift stocks.

Despite concerns that the robust bull rally will tire and pull back, JPMorgan head global equity   Mislav Matejka says stocks could still post giant gains ahead. “Our key theme remains that the current market backdrop has similarities to ’15-’16 mid cycle   episode, and not to the end of the cycle. Similarly, we believe the current bounce is far from done and we believe equities could potentially make new highs for the cycle before the next   starts,” he wrote in a recent report quoted by  . During the correction in 2015-2016, Matejka says that stocks fell by nearly 20%, but then rallied by 43% over the next two years. It's not clear what index he used as a benchmark, but presumably it was a global index. In the U.S., the   had an even more impressive rebound, up by 60.2% from Feb. 11, 2016 to Sept. 20, 2018, after a 13.3% correction from Nov. 3, 2015 to Feb. 11, 2016, based on closing prices. Matejka's   reasons for optimism include the   turn by the  , stability in the  , and his expectation that the U.S. and China will reach a trade agreement. Also, he says, "In contrast to the popular wisdom, we believe that China is healthier now than it was in [the] '15-'16 episode." Michael Darda, chief economist and chief market strategist at research firm MKM Partners, says that the Fed's dovish actions have averted a recessionary "hard landing" for the economy, per  . “The level of the ISM New Orders Index remains consistent with ongoing growth in earnings estimates and capital spending,” he says. Both the S&P 500 and the   have posted year-to-date gains of better than 11% through the end of February, their best opening two months of any year since 1991 and 1987, respectively, per MW. "A positive January-February has historically led to a positive year 87% of the time since 1928 and an average +16.8%  ," as Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, stated in a note to clients cited by MW. Inflation-adjusted   growth in the U.S. is slowing markedly from an annualized rate of 3.4% in 3Q 2018 to 2.6% in 4Q 2018, and again to a projected figure of less than 1.0% in 1Q 2019, per another   article. The   predicts 0.88% first quarter growth, while the   forecasts a mere 0.3% expansion. Unless growth picks up markedly in the rest of 2019, the bull market's momentum could slow dramatically. The February jobs report is due on Friday, with the consensus forecast calling for 185,000 new nonfarm jobs, per Barron's. Also, U.S.-China trade talks continue, and Erik Ristuben, chief investment strategist at Russell Investments, warns per another MarketWatch story, "The bar right now for a deal is very high, and there's plenty of room for disappointment." He believes that the market has priced in all the potential good news, raising the downside risk.

Target Corporation ( ) shares moved nearly 5% higher on Tuesday morning after the retailer reported better-than-expected fourth quarter financial results. Revenue was flat at $22.98 billion, beating consensus estimates by $70 million, and non-GAAP   (EPS) came in at $1.53, beating estimates by one cent per share.   rose a strong 5.3% during the quarter, beating expectations of an even 5% gain. These gains were led by digital sales that rose 31%. The company expects full-year EPS of between $5.75 and $6.05, which was higher than the $5.61 per share that analysts expected to see. CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC that new small formats in places like New York have performed very well, while investments in house brands are driving   gains across important categories. Investments made in fulfillment also appear to be paying off, with online pickup and same-day deliveries in some areas. From a technical standpoint, Target stock broke out from a rising   chart pattern to 200-day moving average and R2 resistance at around $76.80. The   (RSI) moved closer to overbought levels with a reading of 67.99, but the   (MCAD) could see a near-term bullish crossover after a prolonged sideways movement. These indicators suggest that the stock could see some near-term   before resuming its trend higher. Traders should watch for a breakout from the 200-day moving average and R2 resistance toward reaction highs of around $86.00 over the coming sessions. If the stock fails to remain above   and R1 levels at $74.75, traders could see a move lower to test trendline support at around $73.00 or   support at $71.60, although the strong earnings are likely to keep the stock moving higher over the near term.

Chesapeake Energy Corporation ( ) shares rose more than 6% on Friday and extended the stock's rally following Wednesday's better-than-expected earnings. The energy giant reported fourth quarter oil, natural gas and   (NGL) revenue that rose 37.3% to $1.73 billion, beating consensus estimates by $660 million, and non-GAAP net income of 21 cents, beating consensus estimates by three cents per share, driven by higher natural gas prices. The company's production fell 7% year over year to 464,000 barrels per day, and production expenses increased 15% to $2.87 per   (BOE), but full-year adjusted   per BOE reached $12.81 – the highest level since 2014. Management expects EBITDA per BOE to rise 12% to 15% in 2019, based on recent strip prices, generating meaningfully stronger cash flow. Oil production is expected to rise 32% to 116,000 to 122,000 barrels per day, while   is projected to remain roughly flat at $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. From a technical standpoint, the stock broke out from an   pattern during Friday's session. The   (RSI) reached overbought levels of 70.18, but the   (MACD) experienced a bullish crossover. These indicators suggest that the stock could see some near-term   before continuing its intermediate-term trend higher. Traders should watch for some consolidation above trendline support at around $3.00 over the coming sessions. If the stock breaks out from R1 resistance at $3.20, traders could see a further move toward R2 resistance at $3.45 before consolidation. If the stock breaks below trendline support at $3.00, traders could see a move lower to retest the   at $2.75 or lower trendline support near the 50-day moving average at $2.55, although that scenario appears less likely to occur following the strong Q4 financial results.

Shares of The Kroger Co. ( ) sold off more than 4% on Friday after Amazon.com, Inc. ( ) announced plans to open "dozens" of grocery stores in major American cities. The initiative will offer "products at lower price points" than wholly owned Whole Foods while cutting into   at rivals that also include Dow component Walmart Inc. ( ), Costco Wholesale Corporation ( ), Target Corporation ( ) and Dollar General Corporation ( ). Kroger stock fell to a two-month low and rebounded into the weekend, with market players squaring positions ahead of Thursday's fourth quarter earnings, when the supermarket chain is expected to report 52 cents in profit on $28.4 billion in revenues. A 3% year-over-year revenue decline and mixed   in December's confessional generated a week-long uptick, followed by a swift decline to a six-month low in the mid-$20s. Amazon expects to open a Los Angeles store by year end, followed by potential roll-outs in San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Washington DC and Philadelphia. The carefully worded description of expected price points attempted to deflect fears that the initiative will cut into Whole Foods sales, but that store's trendy customers are likely to compare costs despite Amazon's efforts to rope off the new chain. The e-commerce giant also needs to worry about market share with mainstream customers that pay the lowest prices possible to make ends meet. Rivals already fill this demographic to the saturation point, and these folks will be unmoved by lower prices that are still higher than their neighborhood chain or big box store. In addition, Amazon's reputation has been damaged badly in the past year, with a botched headquarters search that has exposed questionable tax breaks and labor practices. Kroger stock topped out at a   $17.45 in 1999 following a multi-year bull run that started at $1.05 in 1989. That marked the highest high for the next 13 years, ahead of a decline that unfolded through two selling waves into a five-year low at $5.50 in 2002. Buyers returned during the mid-decade bull market, lifting the price into   at the .786   level in the mid-teens in 2007. A persistent sell-off reached the single digits in 2009 and eased into a   pattern that held close to the low for more than three years. The stock finally turned higher in 2012, entering a dramatic recovery wave that completed a breakout above the 1999 high in 2013. It posted impressive gains into 2015, topping out at an all-time high at $42.75 in January 2016 and selling off to a three-year low at $20 in 2017. Price action into 2019 has held between the 2015 high and the 2017 low. A Fibonacci grid stretched across the downtrend that started in 2015 highlights stubborn resistance at the 50% retracement level in the lower $30s. The stock has failed four attempts to mount that level since February 2017 and has now contracted into a narrow range pattern with   at the closely aligned 50- and 200-day   (EMAs). The .382 retracement of the 2009 into 2015 uptrend cuts through the middle of this pattern, indicating that price action has reached a major inflection point. A breakdown through the 50% rally retracement at $26 would set off a preliminary   that increases the odds for a decline into the 2017 low near $20, while a breakout above the 50% sell-off retracement would set the stage for an eventual test at the 2015 high. Daily   readings posted a two-year high in November 2018 and have drifted lower into March 2019, but this unusually loyal sponsorship tilts the odds in favor of a bullish long-term outcome. Kroger and other chains that sell groceries lost ground on Friday after Amazon announced a major initiative that could reduce competitor market share and revenues in coming years.

Discount retailer Ross Stores, Inc. ( ) has been rising above its 200-day   since the level was tested as support at $87.73 on Jan. 10. The stock has a gain 14% so far in 2019 and is in bull market territory at 25% above its Dec. 24 low of $75.91. Consumers love to shop for off-price brand-named apparel and household goods, but the stock had a tough fourth quarter. From its all-time intraday high of $104.35 set on Nov. 8, the stock quickly fell into bear market territory, plummeting 27% to its Dec. 24 low. Investors should realize that the near-term bull market is a   of this bear market. Ross stock is not cheap, as its   is 23.36 and its   is 0.95%, according to Macrotrends. In addition, the high at $96.21 on Friday, March 1, was a test of my annual risky level at $95.62, a level at which investors should have reduced holdings. Analysts expect Ross Stores to report quarterly   (EPS) of $1.13 when the company releases results after the closing bell on Tuesday, March 5. The retailer has reported better-than-expected EPS in the past 10 quarters. The bear market for the stock reflects a year-over-year decline in revenue. Wall Street bulls cite better pricing, cost containment and store expansion plans as positives for Ross stock. The daily chart for Ross Stores clearly shows the bear market decline that ended on Dec. 24. The Dec. 31 close of $83.20 was a major input into my proprietary analytics. My semiannual and quarterly value levels converge at $89.28 and $89.21, with my annual risky level now a pivot at $95.62. The Feb. 28 close of $94.83 resulted in my monthly risky level at $100.56. The weekly chart for Ross Stores is positive but  , with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $92.64. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average, or " ," at $67.77. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow   is projected to rise to 84.23 this week, up from 79.48 on March 1. The horizontal lines are the   levels of the bear market decline from $104.35 in November to the Dec. 24 low of $75.91. The stock is above its 61.8% retracement at $93.47. Buy shares of Ross Stores on weakness to my semiannual and quarterly value levels at $89.28 and $89.21, respectively, and reduce holdings on strength to my annual and monthly risky levels at $95.62 and $100.56, respectively.

Target Corporation ( ) reports fourth quarter earnings ahead of Tuesday's opening bell, with analysts expecting   (EPS) of $1.52 on revenue of $23.0 billion. The stock fell more than 10% in reaction to November's third quarter confessional after the big box giant missed profit and revenue estimates. Look for a more bullish reaction this time around, whatever the results, thanks to trade deal optimism that has lifted retail   to five-month highs. Target stock has underperformed badly in recent years and is now trading at a price level first struck in 2013. Self-inflicted wounds from a well publicized hacking incident as well as   lost to e-commerce have driven this mixed price action, which is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. Even so,   technical readings could support a period of healthy buying interest that brings the 2018 high back into play. The stock has traded on U.S. exchanges since at least 1969. It broke six-year   near a   $7.00 in 1996, entering a powerful trend advance that stalled in the upper $30s in 1999. It sold off into the mid-$20s in 2000 and bounced strongly, testing resistance repeatedly into a January 2002 breakout that stalled in the mid-$40s in February. Sellers took control a few months later, triggering a failed breakout and decline that nearly reached 2000 range  . A 2004 breakout signaled a healthy period that added more than 20 points into the 2007 high at $70.75 before rolling over in a decline that failed breakout support once again. The subsequent decline ended within four points of the 2000 low in March 2009, continuing sideways action in place for more than a decade, ahead of an uptick that took four years to complete a round trip into the 2007 high. The stock finally cleared resistance in 2014 and lifted into the mid-$80s in 2015, but the uptrend failed to hold support once again, breaking down after nearly 18 months of testing. This decline hit a five-year low in the upper $40s, yielding a bounce that posted an all-time high less than five points above the 2015 high in September 2018. An eight-point November sell   after third quarter earnings failed this breakout, continuing the multi-decade string of  . The monthly   reached the oversold zone and crossed into a buy cycle in 2011, 2014 and 2017. It turned higher after failing to reach that extreme level in February 2019, lowering the reliability of the currently bullish signal. This makes sense, with the 2019 bounce reaching November 2018's massive unfilled gap, which could take months of buying pressure to overcome.  organize price action since 2017, with the 2019 uptick stalling at the alignment between the .382 rally and .50 sell-off retracement levels. The 200-day   (EMA) has dropped into narrow alignment with this harmonic barrier, highlighting strong resistance between $73 and $75. The 50-day EMA is acting as support in this complex pattern, aligned at the .382 sell-off retracement level near $72. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator posted a 10-year high when price hit an all-time high in September 2018. It held high in the 2018 range during the fourth quarter swoon, indicating loyal sponsorship, but the indicator has barely budged so far in 2019. Unfortunately, this may indicate that   has driven the majority of upside since December rather than fresh buying interest. Summing up, Target stock's rally into March has stalled at 200-day EMA resistance ahead of this week's earnings. A large buy gap could mark a bullish change in character, while a small buy gap or decline is likely to attract follow-through selling interest. The gap fill at $78 marks major resistance, limiting the potential gains following a strong buy-the-news reaction, while a decline that pierces the February low at $69 could imply a return to the 2018 low. Target stock has bounced to resistance ahead of this week's earnings report, with the odds now evenly divided between a bullish and bearish reaction.

Many stock investing themes that outperformed during the long U.S. economic expansion are proving to be outmoded given the sharp downshift in the economy, rising costs and thinning corporate profit margins. As a result, "We recommend investors own stocks with low operating leverage and sell companies with high operating leverage," says Goldman Sachs. "The drag on sales from a slowing economy will be less for low   stocks given they have more stable   due to higher   as a percentage of revenue," Goldman Sachs observes in a recent report. This is the second of two stories devoted to that topic. Our   explained Goldman's analytical framework and highlighted six stocks in their recommended basket of 50 low operating leverage companies. In this story, we look at eight more low operating leverage stocks, including AMETEK Inc. ( ), Waters Corp. ( ), Philip Morris International Inc. ( ), Constellation Brands Inc. ( ), Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. ( ), DaVita Inc. ( ), Biogen Inc. ( ), and Copart Inc. ( ). (Based on Low Degree of Operating Leverage) In its latest U.S. Weekly Kickstart report, Goldman says these stocks are ideally suited for an economy that has sharply decelerated while c  revenue growth estimates for   firms have also been cut. As the degree of operating leverage falls, variable costs -- rather than   -- represent a comparatively greater proportion of total expenses. In a macro environment where sales are likely to decline, companies with low operating leverage will endure a smaller percentage drop in profits for a given percentage decrease in revenues than will companies with high operating leverage. Stocks with low operating leverage offer superior   versus their counterparts with high operating leverage, Goldman says. Additionally, low operating leverage stocks have much more attractive   than stocks with high levels of forecasted revenue growth, which recently have been one of the investment baskets favored by Goldman. Among the eight stocks listed above, the   for kidney dialysis center operator DaVita indicate that revenues are expected to increase by just 2%, but   by 27% in 2019. Since stocks with low operating leverage should, by definition, normally see percentage changes in profits that are smaller than their changes in sales, this suggests that other factors are in play. DaVita recently sold its underperforming managed care subsidiary, DaVita Medical Group, to UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( ), which may be creating some one-time impacts on earnings. DaVita plans to use much of the proceeds to reduce debt and  . Share repurchases, in turn, will shrink the equity base and thus increase EPS. Goldman's shift in emphasis from stocks with high revenue growth to those with low operating leverage offers an example of how investors would do well to reassess their portfolio holdings and their strategies regularly. For example, while high relative valuations for stocks with superior projected growth may make them unattractive as new purchases, they may be worth keeping if they were acquired at much lower prices.

Many companies that have bought back more than 25% of their shares since 2010 have posted massive stock gains longterm, including Apple Inc. ( ), Travelers Companies Inc. ( ), Home Depot Inc. ( ), Northrop Grumman Corp. ( ) and Autozone Inc. ( ). This is happening despite increasing criticism from critics, including in Washington, that buybacks are a misallocation of assets. In 2019, companies are boosting buybacks at a $1.140 billion annual rate, up from more than $900 million last year, per a detailed column in   on 'Buyback Monsters,' which are companies that have bought back unusually large amounts of their shares. Since 2010, for example, Apple's stock has risen more then six-fold as it reduced its shares by 26% while Travelers stock has more than tripled as it lowered shares outstanding by 51%. And Northrop Grumman's stock soared more than six-fold as it cut shares outstanding by 45%. The percent gains in performance were estimated by Investopedia. (% gain since January 2010) (% stock bought back since 2010) U.S. corporations have already announced $190 billion in buybacks this year, per The New York Times. Since 2009, S&P 500 companies have returned nearly $5 trillion to shareholders through buybacks, accounting for roughly 2% of their annual earnings growth, per JPMorgan, as outlined by  . This trend has driven the number of shares outstanding to a 20-year low, and has spurred some politicians in Washington to propose restrictions on the ability of corporations to repurchase their shares. Critics say any reduction in share count means that earnings appear that much better, without any real changes in company fundamentals, according to a CNBC. Home Depot, though, may be an example of how these buybacks can benefit investors. The company's stock has soared nearly 8-fold since 2010, during which it bought back 35 percent of its shares. Now, Home Depot is the latest blue chip company that has announced major buy backs this year. As the company announced weaker-than-expected guidance in its quarterly financial report this week, it also told investors it planned to purchase $15 billion of Home Depot stock. The latest move would further reduce shares outstanding by another 7% if executed and not diluted with stock options, per CNBC. Market watchers expect massive buybacks to continue following the near $1 trillion announced last year on the back of President Trump’s sweeping corporate tax cuts. JPMorgan strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas is one of them, highlighting the $1 trillion in cash U.S. corporations still hold overseas, as well as the fact that the U.S. equity market is now much cheaper, per Barron’s. He expects S&P 500 companies to announce another $800 billion of repurchases in 2019. Despite these stocks' outperformance since 2010, they are likely to receive rising criticism as their share gains slow in the short term in 2019. The debate will continue whether the trillions spent on buybacks is a better use of funds than avenues like giving employees raises, and investing in new equipment and research.

Aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corporation ( ) rallied to a four-month high on Thursday after President Donald Trump walked away from a Hanoi peace summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The world's largest defense contractor builds state-of-the-art missile and anti-missile systems as well as fighter jets that could be used to deliver payloads in the event of a military clash with the rogue nation. The stock fell to a two-year low in December, carving the steepest   since 2008, even though military experts warned repeatedly that negotiations were likely to fail. The aborted summit is likely to be followed by new provocations that include the resumption of North Korean missile testing. In turn, that could speed plans to deploy Lockheed's anti-missile defense systems in vulnerable Pacific islands and the U.S. west coast. The stock's current incarnation began with the March 1995 public offering that followed Lockheed Corporation's merger with Martin Marietta Corporation. The IPO opened near $26 and turned higher in a strong uptrend that topped out in the upper $50s in 1998. It sold off to an all-time low at $16.38 in 1999 and bounced strongly, completing a round trip into the prior high in the first quarter of 2002. A breakout into mid-year reversed after adding 12 points, dropping to an 18-month low at $41 in 2003. It took three years for the subsequent recovery wave to reach the 2002 high, yielding an immediate breakout and uptrend that topped out at $120 just six weeks before the October 2008 market swoon. The stock got cut in half in the next six months, dropping to the lowest low since 2005, ahead of a bounce into the upper $80s. That peak marked   for the next three years, finally yielding a breakout to new highs in 2013. The stock posted impressive gains for five years, hitting an all-time high at $363 in February 2018 and turning sharply lower into July. A strong bounce reversed at a lower high in October, setting the stage for a 110-point slide into year end. The 2019 uptick ended the first trip into the 50-month   (EMA) since a 2012 breakout as well as the first decline into the .382   of the nine-year uptrend. It has recouped about 70 points so far this year, remounting the 50-week EMA while signaling a potential bottom. The monthly   dropped into the oversold zone and turned higher in July 2018, but the bullish signal failed just three months later. It bounced above the prior low in January 2019 and crossed over once again, carving a secondary buy signal. However, the 2018   makes it hard to trust the current upward trajectory, at least until the indicator lifts above the September peak at the 60% level. Two-sided price action between January and November 2018 carved a broad   pattern that broke to the downside in December. The stock remounted new resistance in January, signaling a bullish failure-of-a-failure while reestablishing channel   now centered below $280. As a result, a pullback into that price zone could mark a low-risk buying opportunity for long-term positions. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator posted an all-time high in April and turned lower in an orderly distribution phase that reached a 17-month low in December. Buying pressure since that time has been impressive, traversing more than half the distance back to the high, but the red line of lower highs could slow or stall accumulation in the coming weeks. Even so, this former market leader could easily trade at new highs in 2019. Lockheed Martin stock is attracting buying interest after President Trump walked away from the Kim summit without a denuclearization deal.

Department store Kohl's Corporation ( ) offers brand-named apparel, shoes, accessories, and home and beauty products at affordable prices. The stock closed Thursday, Feb. 28, at $67.53, up 1.8% so far in 2019 and up 15.1% since trading as low as $58.67 on Dec. 24.

The stock   lower on poor holiday   when the company reported earnings on Nov. 20. In November, the outlook for the holiday season was cautious, but now the actual results are expected to be positive. Wall Street expects improved sales from Kohl's for the quarter ended in January. The bulls say that Kohl's increased its e-commerce sales and had initiatives to increase foot traffic. Forward guidance will thus be the focus. There is a chance for volatility in Kohl's shares given the stock has tested my monthly risky level at $69.44. The stock is cheap with a   of 12.26 and   of 3.79%, according to Macrotrends. Analysts expect Kohl's to post earnings per share of $2.17 when it reports results on Tuesday. The daily chart shows that Kohl's stock declined by 29.5% from its all-time intraday high of $83.28 set on Nov. 12 to its Dec. 24 low of $58.67. This bear market is being   so far in 2019. The close of $66.34 on Dec. 31 was the major input to my proprietary analytics and resulted in semiannual and annual value levels at $55.45 and $49.19, respectively, with my quarterly pivot at $67.06, which has been a magnet since Jan. 2. The close of $67.53 on Feb. 28 resulted in my monthly risky level for March at $69.44, which was tested on Friday, March 1. The weekly chart for Kohl's is positive, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average at $66.74. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average, or its " ," now at $52.83, last crossed at $50.29 during the week of Dec. 15, 2017. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow   is projected to rise to 47.74 this week, up from 41.97 on Feb. 22. Buy Kohl's shares on weakness to my quarterly pivot at $67.06 and reduce holdings on strength to the 200-day simple moving average of $71.48. My monthly pivot for March has been tested already and should be a magnet.

Weight Watchers International, Inc. ( ), now transitioning into "WW Inc." stumbled badly on Wednesday, with shares dropping more than 35% after the company missed fourth quarter revenue estimates and sharply reduced full-year  . Weight Watchers reported the slowest growth in two years, stoking criticism that a poorly organized roll-out of the new corporate identity has forced customers out the door, confused and frustrated by the branding. The value of Oprah Winfrey's 5.5 million shares in Weight Watchers has dropped by an astounding $586 million since the stock topped out at $105.73 in June 2018, bringing her remaining stake to $131 million. The media mogul purchased 7.5 million shares at prices in the single digits in October 2015, taking 10% ownership in the weight loss and fitness giant, and netted $110 million when she sold 2 million shares in March 2018. The stock closed at a 22-month low in the upper teens on Wednesday but could post new lows in the coming weeks if other analysts match JP Morgan's newly issued $14  . And given the trajectory since the third quarter of 2018, the decline may soon challenge Oprah's entry price at $6.79, highlighting the overriding importance of price targets, profit protection and  , even for high-profile billionaires. The company came public at $30.00 in November 2001, nearly 40 years after being founded by Queens, New York, entrepreneur Jean Nidetch, and the stock topped out just above $50 in the fourth quarter of 2002. It bottomed out within a point of the IPO opening print in 2004 and turned higher, completing a round trip into the prior high more than one year later. An immediate breakout failed to attract buying interest, stalling at $57 in August 2005. That marked the highest high for nearly six years, ahead of a downturn that accelerated during the 2008 economic collapse. The decline broke IPO   in October and bottomed out in the mid-teens in March 2009, while the subsequent recovery wave reached the 2005 peak in February 2011. A breakout added 30 points into May and reversed, yielding a major breakdown in June 2012. Selling pressure continued for another three years, reaching an all-time low at $3.67 just three months before Winfrey made headlines with her large stake. The subsequent uptrend stalled in 2016 and resumed in 2017, entering a parabolic phase that added more than 90 points in just 15 months. The stock posted an all-time high at $105.73 in June 2018 and turned sharply lower, dumping more than 80 points into Wednesday's closing print. The monthly   has reached the deeply oversold reading hit in 2014 and 2015 (blue line). Both of those downturns posted even lower lows after reaching that level, reducing its value as a contrary signal. In addition, the decline has now crossed the .786   of the uptrend that started in 2015, indicating that selling pressure may continue into the 100% retracement. In turn, that would drop Oprah's remaining stake into a net loss. Wednesday's decline broke support at the 2001 IPO opening print for the third time in the stock's public history, striking a psychological blow. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator posted an all-time high with price in June 2018 and has now fallen to the lowest low since May 2017. This signals an aggressive exodus of institutional capital, despite Oprah's reputation as a savvy businessperson. It's difficult to find high-odds reversal levels after months of one-sided price action. Ominously, there's little support in the price history until the 2016 low at $9.73, exposing the decline to another 50% haircut. It's instructive to note that a sell-off reaching that level would place the October 2018 continuation   right at the 50% level, matching its long-held reputation as a halfway point for uptrends and downtrends. An aggressive exit of institutional capital escalated into a full-scale exodus this week after the company formerly known as Weight Watchers warned about growth deceleration.

Shares of footwear retailer Foot Locker, Inc. ( ) are in bull market territory at 26.1% above the Dec. 20 low of $47.07. Based on the stock's 2018 close of $53.20, I show a semiannual risky level of $57.83, which was first tested on Jan. 9 and has been a pivot (or magnet) since then. This strength is   a longer-term bear market decline of 64% from its December 2016 high of $79.43 to its November 2017 low of $28.42. Within this consolidation, the stock traded as high as $61.10 on Feb. 21 thanks to a pre-earnings announcement by the retailer. After the close on Wednesday, Feb. 20, the company announced that it hiked the   by 10% and initiated a   program totaling $1.2 billion. The stock set its 2019 high, which is also its 52-week high, at $61.36 on Feb. 21. This raises the earnings bar when Foot Locker releases quarterly results before the opening bell on Friday, March 1. Analysts expect Foot Locker to post earnings per share (EPS) of $1.36, with the stock fairly valued at a   13.52 with a   of 2.31% according to Macrotrends. The retailer beat EPS estimates in five consecutive quarters, and Wall Street expects this string to continue. Buying expensive athletic footwear is generally not done online – customers prefer to buy shoes in the store after trying them on. Foot Locker had been above a " " since Feb. 6, 2018, when the stock closed at $47.64. A "golden cross" occurs when the 50-day   rises above the 200-day simple moving average, indicating that higher prices lie ahead. This signal almost ended on Nov. 6, when the two moving averages touched each other. This tracked the stock to its 2019 high of $61.10 set on Feb. 21. Note the price   higher on May 25 on a positive reaction to earnings, the price gap lower on Aug. 24 in reaction to earnings and the price gap higher on Nov. 21 following the company's most recent earnings report. Today, the stock is well above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages at $55.52 and $51.74, respectively. The close of $53.20 on Dec. 31 was the input to my proprietary analytics. This resulted in a quarterly value level at $31.72, my semiannual pivot at $57.83 and my annual risky level at $78.79. The close of $55.89 on Jan. 31 resulted in my monthly value level at $50.53. This week's risky level is $62.52. The weekly chart for Foot Locker is positive but overbought, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average at $57.13 and above its 200-week simple moving average, or " ," at $57.74. Note that the stock set its all-time intraday high of $79.43 during the week of Dec. 9, 2016, and then traded as low as $28.42 during the week of Nov. 10, 2017. This bear market decline of 64% is being consolidated. The horizontal lines are the   levels of this bear market decline. Note that the stock has been trading back and forth around its 61.8% retracement of $59.91 for the past two weeks. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow   is projected to rise to 86.10 this week, up from 84.22 on Feb. 22. Buy Foot Locker shares on weakness to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $53.90 and reduce holdings on strength to my annual risky level at $78.79. A negative reaction to earnings could result in a price gap below my semiannual pivot at $57.83, while a positive reaction to earnings could result in a price gap to a new 2019 high.

Dow component The Home Depot, Inc. ( ) is struggling despite the first quarter's upbeat price action, hit by heavy selling pressure after this week's fourth quarter earnings release. The stock has been testing 200-day   (EMA) support for the past four weeks and could break down soon, exposing a decline that tests 2018's 52-week low in the $150s. In turn, that may signal the final phase of a long-term top that ends the stock's multi-year bull run. The company beat profit estimates by nine cents and reported in-line revenues on Tuesday, but weak full-year earnings   prompted a sell-the-news reaction, with market players worried that slowing home sales will undermine growth. Relatively strong metrics from rival Lowe's Companies, Inc. ( ) on Wednesday failed to ease those fears, triggering a 2% slide for Home Depot shares that has brought the weekly lows back into play. The stock turned higher at 23 cents in 1985, entering a powerful uptrend that prompted six   into the 1992 high at $11.45. It paused around that level for more than four years and took off in a fresh advance that added three additional splits before topping out at $69.75 on the last trading day of 1999. That marked the highest high for the next 13 years, ahead of multi-wave downturn after the   burst in 2000. Selling pressure ended at a five-year low near $20 in February 2003, giving way to a proportional bounce that stalled in the mid-$40s in 2004. Price action completed a   breakdown in 2007, generating a downtrend that accelerated during the 2008 economic collapse. The decline posted an 11-year low during the October crash and tested that level successfully in March 2009, completing a   reversal that yielded modest upside into 2010. Buyers returned in 2012, triggering a rapid advance into the 1999 high, followed by a 2014 breakout that generated healthy returns into the January 2018 high at $208. A pullback to $170 attracted  , yielding a bounce that exceeded the prior high by six points in September, ahead of a downturn that failed the breakout. The stock broke range support in December, posting a 15-month low, followed by a first quarter uptick that ended in the $190s this week. The monthly   crossed into a buy cycle last month after failing to pierce the oversold level. It dropped in two waves into that level, raising doubts about the most recent upturn because complex indicator waves frequently print three waves, up or down. A rally above the weekly high at $193.42 would ease those concerns while lifting the indicator toward the panel's midpoint. The 2018 decline broke the 200-day EMA in October, while November and January bounces failed to remount new resistance. The uptick into February succeeded, but momentum then died, yielding a month of testing at new support. The stock is trading at the moving average this morning, with a potential bounce setting off a short-term buy signal, while a breakdown would set off an intermediate sell signal. The   (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator has dropped to an 18-month low even though the stock is trading in the middle of the multi-year trading range. This marks a bearish   that reveals an aggressive exit by institutional capital focused on the cyclical housing sector. OBV is now situated lower than the December low, raising the potential for a rapid decline into that price zone. A downturn into the lower red line would now complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern, even if the current recovery wave fails to print a right shoulder at the upper red line. This is ominous because last decade's uptrend into 2007 ended with a head and shoulders breakdown. However, there's no urgency to rush for the exits at this time because the stock is still trading 30 points above the  . Home Depot stock may be carving the final stages of a long-term topping pattern that ends the 10-year uptrend.

Fitbit, Inc. ( ) shares fell more than 10% on Thursday morning despite the company posting better-than-expected fourth quarter financial results. Revenue was flat at about $571.2 million, beating consensus estimates by $1.85 million, and non-GAAP   reached 14 cents per share, beating consensus estimates by seven cents per share. Active users grew about 9% to 27.6 million, but changes to the product mix sent   slightly lower to 38.7% during the quarter. Despite the strong financial results, the company's weak   caught the market off guard. Fitbit expects to generate revenue of $250 million to $268 million during the first quarter, which was short of the $272.3 million that analysts were expecting to see. The company's full-year revenue target of $1.52 billion to $1.58 billion is still on par with analyst estimates of $1.57 billion, but   are expected to come down, leading to breakeven   at best. Furthermore, Fitbit faces increasing competition from Apple Inc.'s ( ) Apple Watch, Garmin Ltd.'s ( ) smartwatches and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS) product lines. From a technical standpoint, Fitbit stock moved sharply lower to the middle of its price channel near the 50- and 200-day moving averages and   at $5.75. The   (RSI) fell to neutral levels of 42.79, but the   (MACD) continues to trend lower. These indicators suggest that the market remains indecisive at the moment, but the intermediate-term trend is still slightly bearish. Traders should watch for a rebound from the pivot point as well as 50- and 200-day moving average  . If that happens, traders could see a move toward R1   at $6.70 over the coming sessions. If the stock breaks down from these levels, traders could see a move toward S1 support at $5.23 or lower trendline support at $5.00.

Cyber Monday, also known as "Black Monday," is an e-commerce term, referring to the Monday following the U.S. Thanksgiving weekend. As brick and mortar stores do with Black Friday, online retailers will usually offer special promotions, discounts, and sales on this day; traditional retailers will offer exclusive, "website only" deals. It's known as the unofficial start of the online holiday shopping season. While Black Friday remains the biggest shopping day of the year overall, Cyber Monday is the biggest online shopping day.   often herald their promotions and sales prior to the actual day to compete against the Black Friday offerings at brick-and-mortar stores. For example, some retailer's Cyber Monday deals are available at 12:01 A.M. on Thanksgiving Day. As a result, in terms of overall sales figures, Cyber Monday is quickly catching up to Black Friday. The term Cyber Monday was coined in 2005 by Shop.org, the online arm of the   (NRF). The trade association had noted that, for the last few years, web purchases often spiked on the Monday after Thanksgiving. There were a few different theories as to why. One suggested that people saw items in stores and shopping malls over the weekend but waited until Monday to buy them at work, where they had computers with faster internet connections. (Remember, in the early 21st century, there were no smartphones or tablets, and high-speed, broadband options for residences were in their infancy.) Another related the phenomenon to the unpleasant experience Thanksgiving-weekend shopping had become. If you were looking to land some phenomenal post-Turkey Day bargains, you could skip the family feast, camp out in the parking lot of your favorite store and fight your way through a mob of rabid bargain hunters at the break of dawn on  . Or you could roll out of bed on Monday morning, pour yourself a cup of coffee and browse the web for rock-bottom prices. Tough choice. With its official naming, the day became designated as one for deals and discounts, reinforcing its popularity. That year, in 2005, Cyber Monday sales rose 26%, to $486 million. By 2011, they'd hit the $1.25 billion mark. In 2012, a CouponCabin.com survey found that 42% of consumers planned to scope out the deals on Black Friday but make their purchases on Cyber Monday. In 2014, the Cyber Monday online deals (which, by this time, were often available on Black Friday as well) were so appealing, many shopping websites were overwhelmed with visitors. While some sites slowed to a snail’s pace, others (including HP.com and BestBuy.com) crashed altogether. Even so,   sales hit record highs, around $2.4 billion. Each year's sales top the last; 2017 set a new record: total sales numbers for Cyber Monday were $6.59 billion, up 91% from the year before, according to a report released by Adobe. In 2018, as many as 75 million people are expected to shop online on Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation, spending up to $8 billion. For store-specific sales, the biggest participants of Cyber Monday include:

Or you could roll out of bed on Monday morning, pour yourself a cup of coffee and browse the web for rock-bottom prices. Tough choice. With its official naming, the day became designated as one for deals and discounts, reinforcing its popularity. That year, in 2005, Cyber Monday sales rose 26%, to $486 million. By 2011, they'd hit the $1.25 billion mark. In 2012, a CouponCabin.com survey found that 42% of consumers planned to scope out the deals on Black Friday but make their purchases on Cyber Monday. In 2014, the Cyber Monday online deals (which, by this time, were often available on Black Friday as well) were so appealing, many shopping websites were overwhelmed with visitors. While some sites slowed to a snail’s pace, others (including HP.com and BestBuy.com) crashed altogether. Even so,   sales hit record highs, around $2.4 billion. Each year's sales top the last; 2017 set a new record: total sales numbers for Cyber Monday were $6.59 billion, up 91% from the year before, according to a report released by Adobe. In 2018, as many as 75 million people are expected to shop online on Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation, spending up to $8 billion. For store-specific sales, the biggest participants of Cyber Monday include:

Investors interested in buying into Warren Buffett's   have two options: Class A stock ( ) and Class B stock ( ). The two types of shares each provide access to the famous conglomerate, but they have important differences. The main difference between the two types of shares is their price. As of November 2018, Berkshire Hathaway Class A is trading for around $329,665 per share, compared with $220 for the  . But there are other distinctions as well, and we'll explore them below. More than 20 years ago, the company was content with its highly valued, single class of stock. But the market was demanding a lower-priced, more common-stock nibble at the Berkshire pie, given that shares were trading for around $30,000 at that time. So in 1996,  , CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and the board responded by issuing 517,500 shares of Class B shares ( ), offering the ability to invest in the company for, initially, one-30  the price (and equity) of a   of stock. A 50-to-1   in 2010 sent the ratio to one-1,500th. Class B shares carried correspondingly lower voting rights as well (one-two hundredth of the per-share voting rights), and Buffett marketed Class B shares as a long-term investment and as an open ended offering so as to prevent volatility as a result of supply concerns. The main reason for the introduction of Class B shares was to allow   to be able to purchase the stock directly instead of having to go through  , or   that mirror Berkshire Hathaway's  . Buffett explained this as follows in his 1996 annual letter to shareholders: "As I have told you before, we made this sale in response to the threatened creation of unit trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look-alikes. In the process, they would have used our past, and definitely non-repeatable, record to entice naive small investors and would have charged these innocents high fees and commissions." If the stock was left in the hands of unit trusts, "Berkshire would have been burdened with both hundreds of thousands of unhappy, indirect owners (trustholders, that is) and a stained reputation." Unlike the Class B shares, which split in 2010 and could potentially split again, Class A shares in Berkshire will never experience the same phenomenon. Buffett has declared that the   will never experience a   because he believes the high share price attracts like-minded investors, those focused on long-term   rather than on short-term price fluctuations. Along with being more accessible to  , Class B shares offer the benefit of flexibility. If an investor owns just one share of Class A and is in need of some  , the only option is to sell that single share, even if its price far exceeds the amount of  he needs to access. In contrast, a holder of Class B shares can   part of his or her Berkshire Hathaway holdings just up to the amount needed to meet   requirements. Class B also provides a potential  . Its much lower price means that BRK-B stock can be passed to heirs without triggering the   as passing Class A shares does. One final difference is that Class A shares can be   into an equivalent amount of Class B shares any time a Class A   wishes to do so. The   does not exist in reverse. Class B shareholders can only convert their holdings to Class A by selling their Class B shares and then buying the equivalent in Class A. Given that Class A shares of Berkshire are currently priced at well over $300,000 each and that a split of this class of shares is extremely unlikely (as is a dramatic price decline), most everyday investors do not have much of an option of which type of share to buy if they're interested in buying into Berkshire. For those investors able to make a decision between investing in a smaller number of Class A shares or a much larger number of Class B shares, there are a few pros and cons of each to keep in mind. When it comes to pure performance, there can be a difference between Class A and Class B shares, even though they both represent a stake in the same company. Market dynamics and differing pools of investors are likely to be the primary reason for this, but it is worthwhile to note that there could be performance decisions included in a comparison of the two types of shares. Historically, Class A shares have tended to slightly outperform Class B shares, but this is by no means a guaranteed outcome into the future. The primary pros and cons for each type of share have to do with the differences illustrated above. Investors looking for flexibility or without a great deal of money to invest in Berkshire will most likely opt for Class B shares; someone looking to adjust his or her stake in Berkshire in a more granular way will likely find the dramatically lower price point of Class B shares to be more conducive. With an equivalent investment in Class B shares, an investor has the opportunity to sell off a portion of his holdings in order to generate an artificial dividend or to better balance his portfolio, as compared with the same investment in Class A shares. On the other hand, Class A shares offer the convenience of a long-term investment without much possibility of a stock split down the line. Still, a potential future stock split of Berkshire's Class B shares could benefit prior Class B holders, too.

A line of credit (LOC) is an arrangement between a financial institution – usually a bank – and a customer that establishes the maximum loan amount the customer can borrow. The borrower can access funds from the line of credit at any time as long as they do not exceed the maximum amount (or  ) set in the agreement and meet any other requirements such as making timely  . A line of credit has built-in flexibility, which is its main advantage. Borrowers can request a certain amount, but they do not have to use it all. Rather, they can tailor their spending on the LOC to their needs and owe interest only on the amount they draw, not on the entire credit line. In addition, borrowers can adjust their repayment amounts as needed, based on their budget or cash flow. They can repay, for example, the entire outstanding balance all at once or just make the minimum monthly payments. A line of credit is a type of  , also known as an open-end credit account. This arrangement allows borrowers to spend the money, repay it and spend it again in a virtually never-ending, revolving cycle. Revolving accounts such as   such as mortgages, car loans and  . With installment loans, also known as   accounts, consumers borrow a set amount of money and repay it in equal monthly installments until the loan is paid off. Once an installment loan has been paid off, consumers cannot spend the funds again unless they apply for a new loan. Most lines of credit are unsecured loans. This means the borrower doesn't promise the lender any   to back the LOC. One notable exception is a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which is secured by the equity in the borrower's home. Unsecured lines of credit tend to come with higher interest rates than secured LOCs. They are also more difficult to obtain and often require a higher  . All LOCs consist of a set amount of money that can be borrowed as needed, paid back and borrowed again. The amount of interest, size of payments and other rules are set by the lender. Some lines of credit allow you to write checks (drafts) while others include a type of credit or debit card. As noted above, an LOC can be secured (by collateral) or unsecured, with unsecured LOCs typically subject to higher interest rates. LOCs come in a variety of forms, with each falling under either the secured or unsecured category. Beyond that, each type of LOC has its own characteristics.  provide access to unsecured funds that can be borrowed, repaid and borrowed again. Opening a personal line of credit requires a credit history of no defaults, a credit score of 680 or higher and reliable income. Having savings helps, as does collateral in the form of stocks or CDs, though collateral isn’t required for a personal LOC. Personal LOCs are used for emergencies, weddings and other events, overdraft protection, travel and entertainment and to help smooth out bumps for those with irregular income.    are the most common type of secured LOCs. A HELOC is secured by the market value of the home minus the amount owed, which becomes the basis for determining the size of the line of credit. Typically, the credit limit is equal to 75% or 80% of the market value of the home minus the balance owed on the mortgage. HELOCs often come with a draw period (usually 10 years) during which the borrower can access available funds, repay them and borrow again. After the draw period, the balance is due, or a loan is extended to pay off the balance over time. HELOCs typically have closing costs including the cost of an appraisal on the property used as collateral. Following passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, interest paid on a HELOC is only deductible if the funds are used to buy, build or substantially improve the property that serves as collateral for the HELOC.  can be either secured or unsecured, but they are rarely used. With a demand LOC the lender can call the amount borrowed due at any time. Payback (until the loan is called) can be forestalled, interest-only or interest plus principal, depending on the terms of the LOC. The borrower can spend up to the credit limit at any time.  are special secured-demand LOCs, in which collateral is provided by the borrower’s securities. Typically, an SBLOC lets the investor borrow anywhere from 50% to 95% of the value of assets in his or her account. SBLOCs are   loans, meaning the borrower may not use the money to buy or trade securities. Almost any other type of expenditure is allowed. SBLOCs require the borrower to make monthly, interest-only payments until the loan is repaid in full or the brokerage or bank demands payment, which can happen if the value of the investor’s portfolio falls below the level of the line of credit.  provide a way for a business to borrow on an as-needed basis instead of taking out a fixed loan. The financial institution extending the LOC evaluates the market value, profitability and risk taken on by the business and extends a line of credit based on that evaluation. The LOC may be unsecured or secured, depending on the size of the line of credit requested and the evaluation results. As with almost all LOCs, the interest rate is variable. The main advantage of a line of credit is the ability to borrow only the amount needed and avoid paying interest on a large loan. That said, borrowers need to   when taking out a line of credit.

A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings certificate with a fixed   and specified fixed interest rate that can be issued in any denomination aside from minimum investment requirements. A CD restricts access to the funds until the maturity date of the investment. CDs are generally issued by commercial banks and are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 per individual.  A certificate of deposit (CD) is a   issued by a bank. It is a   that restricts holders from withdrawing funds on demand. A CD is typically issued electronically and may automatically renew upon the maturity of the original CD. When the CD matures, the entire amount of principal, as well as interest earned, is available for withdrawal. CDs typically do not have a fee unless withdrawn before the maturity date. Most CDs offer higher interest rates than those available from savings and money market accounts.  CDs operate under the premise that you forfeit liquidity for a higher return. Under typical market conditions, long-term CDs have higher interest rates when compared to short-term CDs. There is more uncertainty and risk associated with holding the investment for a long period of time. In addition, because you are forgoing the opportunity to utilize the funds for a specific period, you are compensated by earning more interest.  , whereas CDs typically restrict access. Both CDs and savings accounts are insured by the FDIC or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) for share certificates purchased at a credit union up to a limit of $250,000 per individual. The insurance does not cover early withdrawal penalties for cashing in a CD before maturity.  Although CDs do not provide a high return, especially compared to investing the same amount in the stock market, investing in CDs is considered relatively safe. The funds are insured, and, assuming there are no early withdrawal penalties, the investment is considered to be as safe as cash in a savings or checking account.  In most cases it is possible to withdraw money from a CD before the maturity date, although this action will often incur a penalty. This penalty is referred to as an early withdrawal penalty, and the total dollar amount depends on the length of the CD, as well as the issuing institution. Typical early withdrawal penalties are equal to an established amount of interest.  Most CDs are non-negotiable, meaning they can’t be transferred, sold, bought or exchanged. In most cases, non-negotiable CDs can be cashed in before maturity by paying an early withdrawal penalty.  , also known as NCDs, are just the opposite. They can be sold in the secondary market but can’t be cashed in before they mature. With few exceptions, NCDs are issued in large denominations of $100,000 or more. Another feature of NCDs is that they are short term and have maturity dates of between two weeks and one year.  CDs of less than $100,000 are called small CDs. Some of these CDs will have   requirements. For example, a financial institution may require at least $1,000 for a CD to be opened. CDs for more than $100,000 are called large CDs or  . Almost all large CDs, as well as some small CDs, are negotiable. The term of a CD generally ranges from one month to five years.  Most CDs come with a fixed term and a fixed rate of return. Beyond terms such as small, large, non-negotiable and negotiable, there are several varieties from which you can choose. As CDs typically pay higher interest than savings accounts, but offer lower returns than stocks, they are a good option for those who don’t need access to the cash for a set period and want to minimize risk. A five-year CD with a 3.15% annual percentage yield (APY) compounded monthly will earn $4,258.48 on a $25,000 initial deposit. The same amount of money kept in a savings account that pays 2.25% would earn just $2,973.86, assuming the interest rate stays the same, something that is not guaranteed with a savings account. Online banks tend to have the most competitive rates for both CDs and savings accounts.  Typical CD term lengths range from three months to five years. As noted above, in most cases, the longer the terms, the higher the interest rate. All things being equal, a longer-term CD is better, because it provides the best interest rate. There are exceptions to consider, including whether you may need the funds for an emergency and whether current interest rates are on the rise, making it less attractive to lock in what might end up being a low rate for a long time. Early withdrawal penalties can eat into the return and, in some cases, into principal. While it’s impossible to predict CD rates into the future, the graph below shows just how volatile national average rates can be for terms of one, two, three, four and five years from an historical perspective. If you think interest rates will be going down soon, a five-year term CD might make sense. If you believe rates will go up, shorter term one-year or less CDs may be a smart move.  One way to overcome the disadvantage of the interest rate trade-off between short-term and long-term CDs and hedge against fluctuating rates is to use what’s known as a CD ladder, a strategy that involves dividing the amount to be invested among several CDs with different term lengths - for example: one, two, three, four and five years. This strategy makes a portion of the investment available at regular intervals. As each CD matures, the funds are re-invested in a five-year CD at the then highest prevailing rate. Eventually, you have a portfolio of recurring five-year CDs, each maturing on an annual basis.  As the table below demonstrates, depending on goals and liquidity needs, a CD ladder offers a compromise between short-term and long-term CDs. Assuming an initial investment of $10,000, laddering or splitting the $10,000 into five CDs of $2,000 each at varying interest rates for terms ranging from one to five years and reinvesting into a five-year CD as each matures results in $11,590.59 at the end of five years, with access to at least $2,000 annually. That’s $146.96 more than the $11,443.63 realized by investing the full $10,000 in a one-year CD, paying 2.70% and renewing that CD annually. Investing in a five-year CD at 3.10%, held for the full five years, totals $11,674.25 at the end of year five with no access to the money for the full five years.

An extra   — sometimes called a special or irregular dividend — is a one-time dividend paid to a company’s  . Unlike most dividends, which are paid at regular intervals and in pre-determined amounts, extra dividends are typically announced with little-to-no warning; are usually for significantly larger amounts; are nonrecurring; and are paid in cash. Companies think carefully before they announce an extra dividend, not only because of the outlay of cash, but also because doing so may have other ramifications for the company. An extra dividend is a way for a company to share a windfall of exceptional profits directly with its stockholders. An extra dividend will have the same effect as a regular dividend on a stock’s price, which is that on the   date, the stock price will be reduced by the amount of the dividend declared. However, because a stock’s price generally reflects all of the market’s sentiments, the price could be more or less than that amount. You can think of a special dividend as a one-time “gift” from a company to its shareholders because, for example, the company may have enjoyed strong earnings. But cash can pile up on the   for other reasons, such as the company   a  , a department, or some assets; or, because the firm may have won a lawsuit. Sometimes a company can issue extra dividends if it decides to change its   — that is, the percentage of debt versus the percentage of equity used to finance the company. By decreasing its assets (because dividends are paid out of cash), the firm's debt ratio will increase. A company may use extra dividends strategically — to show shareholders that it is confident in its long-term prospects, for example. By declaring an extra dividend, a company also can signal to the rest of the   that its footing is sound; perhaps to gain more investors, or for other reasons. But whatever the reason, the effect of an extra dividend generally serves to engender shareholders’ loyalty toward the company. So, an extra dividend can be a bonus result of a  , or it can be part of the strategy, itself. Extra dividends also can be useful for companies in  . Because these companies are affected significantly by economic changes, their earnings are unpredictable; they might post a profit in some periods and take a loss in other periods. Hence, cyclical companies can use an extra dividend to create a hybrid payout policy. For example, they can follow the normal dividend cycle, but whenever earnings are good in a particular period, they could distribute a portion of them via the extra dividend. Many investors purposely seek out dividend-paying stocks because they offer the added benefit of a regular income stream. Regardless of whether an investor is interested in generating income, dividends play an important role in the overall performance of any  . And when an investor is looking for stock to hold for the long-term, a company's willingness to pay extra dividends often signals that it is focused on stability, growth, and steady management. A well-known story about an extra dividend is when, on December 2, 2004, Microsoft paid out a special cash dividend of $3.00 per share (for a total of $32 billion), which was worth  . On that day, Steve Ballmer — then-Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft — received a dividend check for $1.2 billion; and Bill Gates — then-co-founder and Chairman of Microsoft — also got a big check of nearly $3.4 billion in dividends. These two executives made a fortune overnight because they were investors in their own company. As an investor in that scenario, imagine buying 1,000 shares in a company and getting paid $0.08 per share every quarter, which is fairly common. After a quarter, you would have $80 and after a year, you would have gained $320, which is fairly decent. Now, imagine that one of those quarterly payments was not $0.08, but instead you received  . That one payment alone would be worth $3,000; which is   And while Gates and Ballmer received billions on that day in 2004, thousands of everyday investors also got checks — for $1,000, $2,000, possibly even $50,000 or more simply by being invested in Microsoft. Can we cash in on a similar extra dividend today? That still might be possible with Microsoft, or other companies with massive amounts of cash that pay large extra dividends; but it is very difficult to find the right companies. And, although extra dividends can look very appealing, there are potential downsides, too.  : Companies might declare an extra dividend thinking that they will have enough cash to fund future projects even after paying the special dividend. But if a company’s judgment is wrong, then the company can risk not being able to take advantage of future opportunities because of having distributed the extra cash. Or, the market could misinterpret a company’s declaring a special dividend to mean that it does not have any new projects to invest in; and this perception could drag down the stock price. Investors looking for growth would not want to be associated with a company that had no   opportunities. : Extra dividends are not predictable. The temporary growth in a company's cash is not organic; it happens because of some special occurrence. So, for a long-term investor, the extra dividend is really not that important. It has no effect, or a small effect, on  ; and it is not considered in the  . Moreover, when a company makes a special dividend payment, its stock price is immediately reduced by the amount of that payment. Sometimes, investors will try to sell their shares after receiving a special dividend payment; but if they do, they are essentially wiping out their own profits by taking a hit on the price of their shares. Also, the more investors who try to sell following a special dividend payment, the more a company's stock price likely will drop. Although special dividends are not necessarily bad, there is no evidence that they provide any long-term benefit to investors. In effect, they are neutral and sometimes can actually be negative, especially if they result in slower long-term   and  . Overall, it is never a good idea to chase special dividends. Rather, it is best to stick with high-quality dividend growth stocks that have occasionally paid out an extra dividend. Just remember to always do your research to make sure that you are investing in a company for the long-term, and one that fits your own unique  , time horizon, and financial goals.

A spousal IRA is a strategy that allows a working spouse to contribute to an IRA in the name of a non-working spouse to circumvent income requirements. This creates an exception to the provision that an individual must have earned income to contribute to an IRA. The working spouse's income, however, must equal or exceed the total IRA contributions made on behalf of both spouses. Spousal IRAs are just regular Roth or traditional IRAs that are used by married couples. They are not joint accounts; each IRA is set up in the name of an individual spouse. As of 2019, the use of a spousal IRA strategy allows couples who are married filing jointly to contribute $12,000 to IRAs  – or $14,000 if they are age 50 or older due to the   provision.  To qualify to make spousal IRA contributions, the couple also must file a joint tax return (married filing jointly). Spousal IRAs can be either traditional or Roth IRAs, and are subject to the same annual contribution limits, income limits and   provisions as   and  s. While IRAs cannot be held jointly in both spouse's names, spouses can share their account distributions in retirement.  Spousal IRAs allow couples to accelerate their retirement savings. An added $6,000 per year over 30 years at 5% rate of return can add up to well over $400,000 at retirement. The IRS has extensive rules on how IRAs must be structured and specific guidelines on how spousal IRA strategies can be deployed. According to the IRS, the amount of your combined contributions can’t be more than the taxable compensation reported on your joint return. See the  . Worth noting is that if neither spouse participated in a retirement plan at work, all of their contributions will be deductible. For married couples filing jointly in which the spouse making the IRA contribution is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $103,000 to $123,000 in 2019, up from $101,000 to $121,000 in 2018,  . For an IRA contributor who is not covered by a workplace retirement plan and is married to someone who is, the deduction is phased out if the couple’s income is between $193,000 and $203,000 in 2019, up from $189,000 and $199,000 in 2018. As of 2019, each half of a couple utilizing a spousal IRA strategy can contribute $6,000 – up from $5,500 in 2018. An additional $1,000 may be contributed by each person if they are age 50 or older. That amounts to total contributions of $12,000 to $14,000 for 2019 or $11,000 to $13,000 for 2018. Contributions must be made by the tax filing deadline (including extensions). For example, you can make a contribution to your 2018 IRA through April 15, 2019, or later if you file for an extension. Spousal IRAs are offered by IRS-approved institutions including banks,  , some credit unions as well as federally insured savings & loan associations.

A traditional IRA (individual retirement account) allows individuals to direct pretax income toward investments that can grow tax-deferred. The IRS assess no   or   income taxes until the beneficiary makes a withdrawal. Individual taxpayers can contribute 100 % of any earned compensation up to a specified maximum dollar amount. Income thresholds may also apply. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible depending on the taxpayer's income, tax-filing status and other factors. Custodians, including commercial banks and retail brokers, hold traditional IRAs and place the invested funds into different investment vehicles per the account holder’s instruction and based on the offerings available. The IRS restricts the amount that one may add to a traditional IRA each year depending on age. The contribution limit for the 2019 tax year is $6,000 for savers under 50 years of age. For the 2018 tax year the limit is $5,500. For people age of 50 and above, higher annual contribution limits apply via a catch-up contribution provision, allowing an additional $1,000 ($7,000 total in 2019; $6,500 total in 2018). In the year you reach age 70½ you are no longer eligible to contribute to a traditional IRA.  When you have both a traditional IRA and an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the IRS may limit the amount of your traditional IRA contributions you can deduct from your taxes. For example, in 2018, if a taxpayer participated in an employer-sponsored program, such as a 401(k) or pension program, the taxpayer would only be eligible to take the full deduction on a traditional IRA if his or her   was $63,000 or less if filing as an individual or $101,000 or less if married filing jointly (fully phasing out at $73,000 and $121,000, respectively). With modified AGIs of $73,000 for singles and $121,000 for married couples,  . In between, there's a partial deduction. For the 2019 tax year, the MAGI deductibility phaseout for single filers starts at $64,000 and fully phases out at $74,000. For those married filing jointly the deductibility phaseout begins at $103,000 and fully phases out at $123,000.  IRA contributions must be made by the tax filing deadline (including any extensions). For example, you can make a contribution to your 2018 IRA through April 15, 2019 – or later if you file for an extension. If you are above the limits, you can still contribute post-tax income to a traditional IRA and take advantage of its tax-free growth, but investigate other options, too. When receiving distributions from a traditional IRA, the IRS treats the money as ordinary income and subjects it to income tax. Account holders can take distributions as early as age 59½.

A late fee is a charge a consumer pays for making a required minimum payment on a credit card after the due date. Late fees encourage consumers to pay on time and may be as high as $27 for the first late payment and $38 for a subsequent late payment. Some credit card issuers will waive the late fee the first time a consumer misses the minimum payment deadline; other credit card issuers do not charge any late fees at all, but only issue cards to consumers with very good to excellent credit – individuals who are unlikely to ever pay late. Still other cards offer no leniency and will charge a late fee even if a cardholder barely missed the payment deadline. It is advisable to pay a credit card bill in full and on time each month, but if a cardholder cannot pay in full, making at least the minimum payment on time means he or she can avoid being charged a late fee. If the cardholder's checking account does not have enough money to cover the credit card payment, not only will the payment still be classified as late, the cardholder will also likely incur a returned payment fee from the credit card issuer and an insufficient funds fee from the bank. Late fees may be incurred on other types of accounts if payment is not received by its due date. Insurance payments, rental fees and other structured payments that follow a schedule may be subject to late fees if the due date is missed. The penalty may be increased as more time passes between the date the payment was expected and when it is finally received. Late fees may be rolled into the outstanding balance and then become subject to interest, further compounding the amount a borrower owes. If a cardholder is late making the minimum credit card payment, he or she will have to pay interest in addition to a late fee. The account may also be subject to  , meaning the interest rate will increase to the penalty APR because the credit card issuer considers the cardholder a higher credit risk. Making a late payment might be a simple oversight, or it could be a sign of financial trouble. Late fees are one of several fees credit card companies charge consumers in order to make money. Credit card consumers are also subject to annual fees,  ,   and  . All of these fees are avoidable, however, if the cardholder carefully selects the credit card, follows the terms and avoids behaviors that trigger such fees.

A cash advance is a   from a bank or an alternative lender. The term also refers to a service provided by many credit card issuers allowing cardholders to withdraw a certain amount of cash. Cash advances generally feature steep interest rates and/or fees, but they are attractive to borrowers because they also feature fast approval and quick funding. There are a variety of cash advances, but the common denominators among all of them are the stiff interest rates and fees. The most popular type of cash advance is borrowing on a line of credit through a credit card. The money can be withdrawn at an ATM or, depending on the credit card company, from a check that is deposited or cashed at a bank. Credit card cash advances typically carry a high interest rate, even higher than the rate on regular purchases: You’ll pay an average of 24% – about 9% higher than the average  for purchases. What’s more, the interest begins to accrue immediately; there is no  . These cash advances usually include a fee as well, either a flat rate or a percentage of the advanced amount. Additionally, if you use an ATM to access the cash, you often are charged a small usage fee. Along with separate interest rates, credit card cash advances carry a separate balance from credit purchases, but the monthly payment can be applied to both balances. However, if you are only paying the minimum amount due, the card issuer is allowed by federal law to apply it to the balance with the lower interest rate. As that is invariably the rate for purchases, the cash advance balance can sit and accrue interest at that high rate for months. In most cases credit card cash advances do not quality for no- or low-interest-rate introductory offers. On the plus side, they are quick and easy to obtain. Merchant cash advances refer to loans received by companies or merchants from banks or alternative lenders. Typically, businesses with less-than-perfect credit use cash advances to finance their activities, and in some cases these advances are paid for with future credit card receipts or with a portion of the funds the business receives from sales in its online account. Rather than using a business’ credit score, alternative lenders often survey its  by looking at multiple data points, including how much money the merchant receives through online accounts such as PayPal. In consumer lending the phrase “cash advance” can also refer to  . Issued by special payday lenders, they can range anywhere from $50 to $1,000, but they come with fees (around $15 per $100 borrowed – or even more in some cases) and interest rates exceeding 100%. Rather than taking into account the borrower’s credit score, the lender determines the amount of the loan based on local state regulations and the size of the applicant’s paycheck. If the loan is approved, the lender hands the borrower cash; if the transaction takes place online, the lender makes an electronic deposit to the borrower’s checking or savings account. The loans are extremely short term – they must be paid back on the borrower’s next payday, unless he or she wishes to extend the loan, and in that case, additional interest is charged. Unfortunately, many do: More than 80% of all payday loans are rolled over within 30 days of the previous loan,   by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( ). The process can be quick, if more complex, than securing a credit card cash advance. To obtain a payday loan, you write a postdated check made out to the payday lender for the amount you plan to borrow, including the fees. The lender immediately issues the borrowed amount but waits to cash your check until the payday arrives. Some electronically minded lenders now have borrowers sign an agreement for automatic repayment from their bank accounts. Lenders usually ask that you provide personal identification and proof of income when you apply. Some employers offer payday loans or advances on paychecks as a service to their employees. Terms vary, but often no fees or interest are charged. Taking out a cash advance has no direct impact on your credit or credit score, but it can affect it indirectly in various ways. First, if you take the advance using a credit card, it will raise your outstanding balance, which will raise your  , a measure that   models use to calculate your score. If you owe $500 on a $1,500 limit card, for example, your credit utilization ratio is 30%. However, if you take out a $300 cash advance on that card, the balance will jump to $800, resulting in a credit utilization of more than 53%.  ; when your ratio exceeds 40%, it can adversely impact your credit score. As noted earlier, a cash advance usually has a high interest rate. If this affects your ability to pay the monthly charges promptly, that also could affect your credit score. And if the cash advance puts you over the card’s credit limit, your credit score can be dinged. Even after the balance is paid down, your credit report will show the highest balance reported, and other potential lenders will see that you were over the limit at one point, which could hurt your ability to get new credit. A credit card cash advance could be a reasonable option for someone who has an emergency need for money and limited resources for getting it, especially when that person has a clear and reasonable plan for paying back the money in a short time period. It is, for example, a better option than a payday loan or a  , due to the exorbitant triple-digit interest rates those loans typically carry and the greater payoff flexibility that comes with credit card debt. But cash advances would be a bad idea under these conditions: Cash advances aren’t alarming when used infrequently, but they are at best short-term solutions to meet emergencies. If they are becoming a habit, or if you find you regularly need a cash advance to make ends meet, then drastic budgeting and spending changes are in order.

An over-limit fee is a penalty charged by a credit card company if a credit card user exceeds the card’s  . Over-limit fees are typically $25 for the first over-limit charge and $35 if you go over the limit a second time within the next six months, though credit card issuers are free to determine their own fees as long as they are reasonable in relation to the cardholder’s over-limit activity. Some card issuers do not charge over-limit fees, and those that do must allow cardholders to opt out of paying them. If a cardholder opts out of over-limit fees, the card will be declined if it does not have enough   to complete a purchase, unless the card issuer allows over-limit charges with no over-limit fee. Over-limit fees have become less common since the passage of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (also known as the  ), although it's not known whether the act is directly responsible for that decrease. However, the law does require creditors to allow consumers to opt out of paying over-limit fees. Opting out means not only that cardholders will not pay over-limit fees but also that they will not be able to spend beyond their credit limit, which restricts how much debt they can get into – at least with a particular card. If they opt in, the over-limit fee cannot be higher than the amount by which they exceed their credit limit. Before the passage of the CARD Act, when credit card issuers charged over-limit fees more regularly, the practice provided an auxiliary form of revenue for the companies. Sometimes consumers would suffer these penalties on a recurring basis if they did not maintain close watch on their spending habits. Thanks to the CARD Act, this happens less frequently now. Here is an example of how the over-limit fee works: Let's say a consumer has opted in to over-limit fees, has a credit limit of $5,000 and a current balance of $4,980, leaving $20 in available credit. This consumer then uses the card to buy dinner, which costs $42 and increases the balance to $5,022. The limit has been breached by $22, so the credit card company can charge, at most, an over-limit fee of $22. If dinner costs $102, the balance will increase to $5,082, exceeding the credit limit by $82. If the consumer has not had an over-limit charge in the previous six months, the credit card issuer will probably charge a $25 over-limit fee. If the cardholder has already gone over the limit at least once in the past six months, the fee will probably be $35.

Co-branding is a   that utilizes multiple   names on a good or service as part of a  . Also known as a brand partnership, co-branding (or "cobranding") encompasses several different types of branding collaborations typically involving the brands of at least two companies. Each brand in such a strategic alliance contributes its own identity to create a melded brand with the help of unique logos, brand identifiers and color schemes. The point of co-branding is to combine the market strength,  , positive associations and cachet of two or more brands to compel consumers to pay a greater premium for them. It can also make a product less susceptible to copying by private label competition. Co-branding is a useful strategy for many businesses seeking to increase their customer bases, profitability, market share, customer loyalty, brand image, perceived value and cost savings. Many different types of businesses, such as retailers, restaurants, car makers and electronics manufacturers, use co-branding to create synergies based on the unique strengths of each brand. Simply put, co-branding as a strategy seeks to gain market share, increase revenue streams, and capitalize on increased customer awareness. Co-branding can be spurred by two (or more) parties consciously deciding to collaborate on a specialized product. It can also result from a company merger or acquisition as a way to transfer a brand associated with a well-known manufacturer or service provider to a better-known company and brand. Co-branding can see more than just name and brand associations; there may also be a sharing of technologies and expertise, capitalizing on unique advantages of each co-branding partner. A co-branded product is more limited in terms of audience than a broad, single-name corporate product. The image it conveys is more specific so companies must consider whether co-branding can yield benefits or if it would alienate customers accustomed to a single name with a familiar product identity. Companies should choose co-branding partners very carefully. As much as a company can benefit from a relationship with another brand, there can also be risks. A good strategy is to slowly roll out a co-branded product or service before publicizing and promoting it, thereby giving the marketplace time to vet it. According to branding and marketing experts there are four distinct co-branding strategies: Co-branding and co-marketing are similar concepts in that both involve partnerships between brands that seek to bolster their marketing efforts, but they differ in how they are executed. Co-marketing aligns the marketing efforts of two partners, but does not result in the creation of a new product or service. Co-branding, by design, is based on the creation of a new product or service. Co-branding is all around you. Consider these examples:

     Keep Me Logged In  and   confirmed on Sunday they were in talks about a merger, prompting labor union concerns about possible job losses and questions from analysts about the merits of a combination. Germany's two largest banks issued short statements following separate meetings of their management boards, a person with knowledge of the matter said, indicating a quickening of pace in the merger process, although both also warned that a deal was far from certain. "In light of arising opportunities, the management board of Deutsche Bank has decided to review strategic options," Deutsche said in its statement. Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, told employees that Deutsche still aimed "to remain a global bank with a strong capital markets business... with a global network." Sewing said many factors could still prevent a merger and a Deutsche spokesman said the talks were expected to last some time. Commerzbank described the outcome as open. However, formal disclosure of talks appeared to boost the chances of concluding a deal first floated in 2016 before the banks opted to focus on restructuring. The German government has pushed for a combination given concerns about the health of Deutsche, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. The government, which holds a stake of more than 15 percent in Commerzbank following a bailout, wants a national banking champion to support its export-led economy, best known for cars and machine tools. Berlin also wants to keep Commerzbank's speciality —the funding of medium-sized companies, the backbone of the economy — in German hands. A merged bank would likely be the third largest in Europe after HSBC and BNP Paribas, with roughly 1.8 trillion euros ($2.04 trillion) in assets, such as loans and investments, and a market value of about 25 billion euros. However, skeptics questioned the wisdom of a merger. "We do not see a national champion here, but a shaky zombie bank that could lead to another billion-euro grave for the German state. Why should we take this risk?" said Gerhard Schick, finance activist and ex-member of the German parliament. While the banks had not publicly commented on merger talks until Sunday, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz last Monday confirmed that there were negotiations. On Sunday, the ministry acknowledged the announcement and said it remained in regular contact with all parties. However, there were signs of political opposition. Hans Michelbach, a lawmaker from the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), urged the government to sell its 15 percent stake in Commerzbank before a deal. "There may not be an ownership by the federal government in a merged big bank indirectly through an old stake. We do not need a German State Bank AG," he told Reuters. The supervisory boards of both banks are scheduled to hold long-planned meetings on Thursday, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The status of merger negotiations is expected to be discussed. A merged bank would have one fifth of the German retail banking market. Together the two banks currently employ 140,000 people worldwide — 91,700 in Deutsche and 49,000 in Commerzbank. Germany's Verdi labor union on Sunday renewed its objections to a merger, saying that tens of thousands of jobs were at risk and that a tie-up added no value. Jan Duscheck, head of the union's banking division and a member of Deutsche's supervisory board, said the union would raise its concerns on both banks' oversight bodies. Deutsche emerged unscathed from the financial crash but later lost its footing. German officials fear a recession or big fine could derail the bank's fragile recovery. Other than Deutsche, Commerzbank is Germany's only remaining big publicly-traded bank, after a series of mergers. Commerzbank has also struggled to rebound, and German officials say it is vulnerable to a foreign takeover. If an international rival snapped it up, that would increase competition for Deutsche on its home turf. Initial reaction among analysts to a deal was skeptical. There will only be limited benefits of adding Commerzbank's clientele of retail and small and medium businesses to Deutsche, said David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management.  "It doesn't change the fact that Germany is not getting a flagship bank that can compete on the world stage. It's still a stunted bank with a lot of problems," Hendler said.  One of the biggest risks is how to fill what one German official has told Reuters will be a multi-billion-euro financial hole because a merger could trigger an adjustment to the valuation of some bank investments. Commerzbank, for example, has about 30.8 billion euros of debt securities such as Italian bonds that now have a value of 27.7 billion euros. A tie-up could crystallize this loss. Deutsche has such securities at market value in its accounts. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Stocks hit a new high for the year this week, back on track to match a post-election pattern that has stood the test of time. The stock market has risen in the year after all 18 midterm elections since World War II, with   delivering an average return of 14.5 percent, according to LPL Financial Research. The pattern is pointing to a longer bull run even after this year's epic rebound. "With the S&P 500 up only 1.3 percent since the midterm election last November, there indeed could still be room for stocks to run in 2019," LPL's Ryan Detrick said in a note on Wednesday. After this week's rally, the stock market has bounced back from December's steep sell-off with   up more than 12 percent year to date. And there are a couple catalysts that could send stocks even higher, including a China trade deal that could take the uncertainty out of the market and a helping hand from the Federal Reserve that already signaled a more "patient" approach to rate hikes and it is  " balance sheet unwind if needed. President Donald Trump,  's fluctuations, is a big champion of this market pattern as he views a booming market as his way to re-election. CNBC reported last week Trump is pushing hard to strike a trade deal with China in the hope of   ahead of his re-election bid. "The third year leading up to an election tends to be a very good one for the market because the president is trying to have the economy and the party in power looking good for getting re-elected," Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said on CNBC's  . The year prior to a presidential election has almost always been a good one — in the last 19 such years, the market is up on average 15 percent and 18 out of 19 times it's been positive, according to Slimmon. The pattern can also be explained by the gridlock situation often seen after an election, where lawmakers and the President are unlikely to do harm or remove any bullish policy that is already in place.

     Keep Me Logged In Stocks kicked off 2019 with a bang as U.S.-China trade tensions simmered while the Federal Reserve signaled patience in raising rates. However, stocks will need improving economic data to make a run at the record levels set last year. The   and   are both 4 percent away from their all-time highs. The   is trading about 5.5 percent away from its record. However, the main catalysts that led stocks to this point — declining worries over China trade and Fed monetary policy — have largely been priced in. Meanwhile, the economic data have been mixed at best. The recent weakness in economic data comes as at a time when global central banks fret over a potential slowdown in the global economy, which investors fear could hurt corporate profits. "What the market needs and must have is a spate of data suggesting the economy continues to expand, albeit slowly, but not stalling," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. "That worry that the economy could stall out has the market worried." The Citi Economic Surprise Index, a widely followed barometer of how economic data do relative to economist expectations, is currently near negative 35 and hit its lowest level since August 2017 earlier this month. A negative print on the index shows a majority of economic data are missing estimates; a positive print indicates data are outperforming expectations. U.S. jobs creation came near to a screeching halt in February  . While some experts attributed the weak print to factors like the weather and the government shutdown, it was still the worst month of jobs creation since September 2017. The National Federation of Independent Business' small-business optimism index, meanwhile, remained near its lowest levels since the 2016 election in February despite inching higher. Retail sales, a widely followed barometer of consumer health,  . However, December sales were revised down to show a 1.6 percent decline. "[Monday's] retail sales report wasn't enough to clear the earlier one out," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth. "December is still a question mark in people's minds." "You have to see an improvement in retail sales," he said. "That's another potential catalyst." Investors are increasingly looking toward economic data since a trade deal between China and the U.S. is likely priced in at this point. China and the U.S. are expected to sign a deal sometime between late March and April. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told CNBC on Feb. 28 the two countries made " " progress in talks last month. China has also agreed to bolster its   to try and narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., a sticking point of President Donald Trump. However, the two sides have yet to come to terms on key structural issues like intellectual property theft. "We doubt this deal will be much of a rally maker," said Donald Straszheim, head of the China research team at Evercore ISI, in a note Monday. "It will not clear the air on US-China relations, and won't spur now nearly-frozen global companies to restart plans on where and how much to invest, produce, hire and source." "We still expect a deal 'lite' – advertised as a win but not clearing the air," he said. The good news for investors, however, is some of the economic data is starting to turn around. Activity in the  , while new home sales climbed to a seven-month high in December. Durable goods orders in the U.S., meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent in January to surpass economist expectations. Constriction spending also rose 1.3 percent in January in to mark its biggest gain in nine months. "What you have to start seeing is what you saw in the service sector in other economic reports. The ISM services index had pared back but then the most recent one was a nice showing. I think you have to see that in manufacturing. That's going to be hard," SlateStone Wealth's Pavlik said. "If you start seeing some of those things, … then it takes off a bit of the concern from the global economy." Not everyone thinks stronger economic data can lead stocks to new highs, however. Paul Schatz, president at Heritage Capital, said stronger economic data could push the Fed's hand into tightening monetary policy, which could be detrimental to equities. "The Fed changed the whole landscape," Schatz said. "You do not need unusually strong economic data. What you can't have is cascading lower economic data, but stable economic data is all the market needs to go higher." "I think we're in that Goldilocks scenario right now. Stocks had a horrific decline and an amazing rally. Our thesis right now is stocks are in a trading range and will continue sideways for a little bit longer and then the next upward assault is going to take place." Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In One canadian pot company is making a huge splash in the U.S. market. Earlier this week, cannabis product retailer   announced it would buy competitor Verano Holdings for $850 million in an all-stock deal, marking the largest U.S. cannabis deal to date. The combined company will be one of the country's largest multi-state operators, presiding over as many as 200 facilities in 16 states. Steve White, the co-founder and CEO of Harvest, has a clear vision for how Verano will bolster Harvest's positioning in the still-developing U.S. pot industry. "Presently, we're in a phase that people are referring to it as a land grab," White told CNBC's   "We plan on ... developing the largest retail footprint, the largest retail platform, in the United States, and with this acquisition, I think we've done that." Harvest currently operates in Arizona, California, Florida, Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and was already planning to open new locations in Massachusetts, Michigan and North Dakota. The Verano acquisition adds Illinois and Nevada to that list, as well as plans for new locations in Puerto Rico, Oklahoma and  . "One of the things that we have been really good at is acquiring licenses when they're actually allocated by the government, which means that we don't have to go out and buy them later for tens of millions of dollars when we can acquire them for a few hundred thousand dollars," White said after announcing the deal on Monday. "What we've seen in Verano is they also have the ability to do that very same thing," he said. "What very few people know is they won more licenses than anyone in the state of Nevada in the recent round of license awards there." That also speaks to Verano's focus on profitability, which White flagged as another reason the companies would fit well together. "We have had an emphasis on profitability from the very beginning of our formation, and when we started talking to Verano, we got the sense, the very clear sense, that they are like-minded in that respect," he said. "They have been running a profitable company for quite some time as well, which, as you know, in the U.S. cannabis industry is quite unique. There's only a few companies that actually run profitably. So, in this case, you've just combined two of them, so there's one less." And, as more and more states pave the way for a legal cannabis market to come to fruition, White suggested that Harvest's name wouldn't stay out of the headlines for long. "We're going to do every single deal that makes sense for Harvest and Harvest shareholders," the CEO said. "For us, we think it's really important to grow faster than our competitors, and so we're going to do everything that we possibly can in order to deliver on that." Harvest's stock, which trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange, gained over 3 percent on Friday, adding to its nearly 14 percent gain for the week. Shares of the company, which also trade over the counter, have climbed more than 52 percent year to date. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In The   closed up 2.9 percent for the week, its best so far this year. It's now at the highest level since early October, after breaking through key resistance levels near 2815, where it failed several times. The S&P is now less than 4 percent from the old historic closing high (2,930 on September 20). Key observations: 1) Traders increasingly believe global central banks have their backs. 2) With the   at 12, its lowest level since October, strategies driven by volatility would likely add to stock exposure. 3) Bond yields continue to drop, remaining near the lows of the year. The new-high list this week was littered with interest-rate sensitive stocks (utilities, REITs) that rally when rates remain low. 4) Quadruple witching (quarterly expiration of index options and futures, and stock options and futures) has added a lot of volume this week and likely contributed to the upside rally. But the question is whether the expiration exhaust near term demand. The S&P 500 tends to be lower in the week after quadruple witching. 5) Europe (and the U.K.) have outperformed the U.S. this month. There are some hopes for a bottom in the recent poor economic data. 6) Downward earnings revisions are slowing to a crawl. The rate of downward earnings revision for the first quarter was intense from January into mid-February, slowed in the next several weeks and has essentially stopped this week. First-quarter earnings are now expected to be down 1.5 percent for the S&P 500, according to Refinitiv. If it stays in that range, there is a good chance earnings will be positive for the first quarter (companies tend to beat analyst estimates), and we will avoid an earnings "recession," at least one that began in the first quarter. 7) The key to a further rally: positive comments on global growth. The two key names next week are Micron and Federal Express, which are both scheduled to report earnings. Both had big drops last quarter and saw lower earnings estimates on concerns over China and (for Micron) increasing competition. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In The Fed's meeting is the big deal for markets in the coming week, and it is widely expected to send a message that investors in both bonds and stocks could find bullish. But analysts in both markets say the Fed's message has been well telegraphed, and market response could be tepid or even a "sell the news" reaction. The key for both markets will be what the economic data shows, after a series of weak reports. Thursday's regional Philadelphia Fed survey and PMI data Friday on manufacturing and the services sectors will be important. Existing home sales are also released Thursday. "The first quarter has not exactly been a hallelujah quarter, and the Fed has to acknowledge that," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady, but it is also expected to issue a new forecast with fewer rate hikes and a slower economy. The Fed also is likely to announce the end of its operation to unwind its balance sheet, but economists are divided on which month this year it will actually end the program. Stocks surged in the past week with the best performance since November for the S&P 500, which ended up 2.9 percent. At the same time Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to fall. The bench mark   Treasury slipped below 2.60 percent Friday, its lowest yield since June 4, and the   was at 2.43 percent. The fact that both markets are rising at the same time is somewhat unusual, and at some point the trend could break in favor of one market versus the other. An easier Federal Reserve, meaning one less inclined to drive up rates, is viewed as a positive for stocks because higher interest rates can slow the economy and send borrowing costs higher for companies and investors. Bond yields also head lower when the Fed is not likely to raise interest rates. "This could be an interesting week," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. He said it should be positive for stocks if the Fed reduces its forecast for rate hikes and delivers on expectations. "This is the meeting where we get more clarity on the balance sheet reduction. Both those things would be an affirmation of where things are right now. It's also technical…where we close [on the S&P] puts us on a precipice of breaking out," said Hogan. The S&P 500 closed at 2,822, near the key 2,825 level which is the upper end of a big band of resistance. "The only down week of the year was the week before this, and the trend has been higher," he said. But Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute chief international investment strategist, said the stock market could actually have little reaction to the Fed because Fed officials have been very dovish in public comments. "It could be neutral or perhaps even negative. What more can they say? You might see some people selling the fact," he said. Christopher said he sees the market as stretched, and it could sell off. But then, there could be a buying opportunity. "We think stocks have to start to feel better about the economy first," he said, adding a trade deal with China could be a positive. The Fed's actions could also already be priced into the bond market, according to George Goncalves, head of fixed income strategy at Nomura. He said what really matters is what risk markets, or stocks, do in response. "There's scope for risk to do better and the Fed's not hiking. You can see it rally into the summer and the economy will look better and if that happens that will be a buying opportunity for rates," he said. Economists see the Fed reducing its forecast for two rate hikes to one or even none for this year. They also expect it to say it will end its program to reduce the balance sheet, but they don't agree on whether that happens in June, September or closer to the end of the year. The Fed is currently reducing its balance sheet by allowing securities to roll down as they mature, instead of replacing all of them as it previously did. It now theoretically could allow $60 billion a month to roll off, but Fed officials could change that program and begin to repurchase securities to replace them. The markets are also waiting to hear if the Fed will focus solely on Treasury securities, and at what part of the curve – or duration. In the past it had purchased mortgages but is expected to discontinue that. "We think they're back to buying Treasurys by Oct. 1. Somethings got to give. At some point, its either that [bond market] people are too pessimistic and the economy is going to do well because the Fed is behind the curve, or we have another kind of correction on our hands in the next six to nine months," he said. "We just have to pass through time There's a powerful faith-based system around easy money can fix all things." Swonk said she expects the Fed to continue to forecast one rate hike for this year. The Fed interest rate forecasts appear as anonymous dots from individual Fed officials on a chart, known as the "dot plot." Even so, she doesn't expect the Fed will actually raise rates but it will continue to give itself flexibility. Economic data has been mixed with some very poor reports, like December's retail sales, which fell 1.6 percent, and February's jobs report, which showed job growth of just 20,000 jobs, 160,000 below forecast. "I think they have to walk a fine line between acknowledging the weakness we've seen and then also show that we're still going to see growth this year," she said. 8:30 a.m. Business Leaders survey 10:00 a.m. NAHB survey FOMC begins 2-day meeting 10:00 a.m. Factory orders 2:00 p.m. Fed statement 2:30 p.m. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell briefing 8:30 a.m. Jobless claims 8:30 a.m. Philadelphia Fed survey 8:30 a.m. Q4 current account 10:00 a.m. QSS 10:00 a.m. Existing home sales 9:30 a.m. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic 9:45 a.m. Manufacturing PMI 9:45 a.m. Services PMI 10:00 a.m. Wholesale trade Got a confidential news tip?

                                            The Mughal Empire may have faded nearly 200 years ago, but its legacy lives on in New Delhi.
                                         
                                            Near the Yamuna River in the medieval Muslim hub of Nizamuddin stands the final resting place of the second Mughal emperor, Humayun. 
                                         
                                                    ommissioned by the emperor’s first wife and chief consort, the Persia-born Haji Begum, and built in 1570, Humayun’s tomb is a masterpiece: a striking red sandstone structure, inlaid with white and black marble, with a bulbous white dome that seems to float above the four lush, symmetrical gardens that surround it. 
                                                        
                                                 
                                        ar from being just a mausoleum for one man, however, Humayun’s tomb was the first grand garden-tomb built in India, and it would influence Mughal architecture for centuries to come. 
                                     
                                            umayun’s tomb features a distinctive blend of Persian and Mughal design elements guided by Islamic principles of geometry. These unique foreign influences helped pioneer a style distinguished by the use of sandstone and marble, delicate latticework, Persian calligraphic inscriptions, onion-shaped domes, recessed archways and   — quartered gardens, divided by walkways or flowing water, that represent the four gardens of Paradise in the Koran. 
                                         
                                                s time wore on, Humayun’s tomb would house the remains of over 150 Mughal family members, including his wife Haji Begum and reputedly his favorite barber, too. In 1857, the complex provided refuge for the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, before he was exiled by the British Raj. 
                                             
                                                    he tomb’s influence, of course, extends to one of India’s most famous landmarks: the Taj Mahal. The construction of India’s ‘monument to love’ in 1653 marked the apex of Mughal architecture, but it would not exist if Humayun’s tomb had not provided a blueprint for it 80 years prior.
                                                 
                                                    Yet it is something of a paradox that such a significant structure was built to honour an emperor who never had more than tenuous grip on power — an emperor who lived in exile for 15 years.
                                                 
                                        ince 1206, much of India had been ruled by the Delhi Sultanate, Turkic-Muslim rulers who overtook a divided Subcontinent following the spread of Islam out of the Middle East. This 320-year succession of dynasties transformed concepts of equality and governance, synthesised Islamic and Indian culture and repelled Mongol advances. But it also suffered from the often-hostile clash of Muslim Turks with Hindu and Buddhist Indians. Not to mention in-fighting.
                                     
                                        The Sultanate finally fractured in 1526. Daulat Khan Lodhi, the governor of Lahore, invited the ruler of Kabul at the time, Babur — a warrior-prince from the Fergana Valley in modern-day Uzbekistan and descendant of Tamerlane and Genghis Khan — to invade Delhi and sack the unpopular sultan Ibrahim Lodhi. Thanks to Babur’s military might and knowledge of gunpowder firearms, his army defeated the Lodhi Dynasty army at the Battle of Panipat. Having struggled to solidify his own domain in Central Asia, Babur finally assumed power in Delhi, establishing the Mughal Empire.
                                     
                                        hilst Babur was known for his might and military savvy, his first son Humayun was not. When Babur died in 1530, 22-year-old Humayun proved unable to consolidate power. After only 10 years as emperor, Humayun was ousted by supporters of the Lodhi Sultanate, led by Afghan ruler Sher Shah Suri, and would go into a 15-year exile in outposts of the Persian Safavid Empire.
                                     
                                        This exile, however, would shape Mughal art, architecture and military in the future. In Herat, Kandahar and Kabul, Humayun developed a taste for Persian painting and poetry. When Humayun overtook a Delhi embroiled in chaos in 1555, he did so with thousands of Persian literary and military figures — as well as his son, Akbar, who was born in exile — in tow. 
                                      
                                        Despite its rulers’ Central Asian roots, the Mughal Empire would be most greatly influenced by the culture, religion and art Humayun experienced in Persia.
                                     
                                            umayun’s return to power would be short-lived. After only six months, he suffered a fall and died from his injuries. Whilst his reign may not have been extraordinary, his legacy would be.
                                         
                                            As Humayun’s son Akbar cemented a favored reputation — uniting almost all of India, extending religious freedoms and founding an administrative system that would last into British rule — Haji Begum planted the seeds from which Mughal art and architecture would bloom, ordering the construction of the greatest mausoleum the Muslim world had seen to that point.
                                         
                                            Today, visitors can experience Humayun’s tomb in its original splendor. The UNESCO World Heritage Site recently underwent six years of restoration work that stripped it of ungainly cement fortifications and returned to its architectural integrity. 
                                         The garden-tomb that inspired the iconic Taj Mahal has rightly regained its status as one of India’s most incredible monuments.

     Keep Me Logged In Ten years off the financial crisis bottom, the stock market scored one of its best decades in nearly 140 years. According to Goldman Sachs, the 10-year trailing annual return for   of 15 percent ranks in the 94th percentile of all 10-year periods going all the way back to 1880. The typical 10-year trailing return since 1880 is 9 percent. (Note the S&P 500 goes back to the 1920s so Goldman likely used a proxy for equity returns back to the 19th century.) "One of the unique parts about the decade-long bull market is that it's been driven by a couple different things in its life," said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research. "In the beginning it was the Fed ... the round after round of QE. That's what really got us going." "Then that transitioned to something more traditionally sustainable, which was an economic resurgence. We saw that in the middle of the decade. And then tax cuts created a earnings-based bull market," he added. The market regained more than 300 percent from its financial crisis intraday low of 666 hit in March 2009. The   hit an all-time high in August 2018 on pro-business policies such as corporate tax cuts. And 2019 has been a record-setting year so far as stocks posted their best start to a year in at least 30 years. The S&P 500 is now just under 5 percent from that August all-time high. But it wasn't all smooth sailing. The most recent market crash happened at the end of 2018 when the stock market suffered its worst December since the Great Depression. Triggered by fears of a too-aggressive   and a possible recession, the S&P 500 plunged 20 percent from its high on an intraday basis through Christmas Eve, dipping into a technical bear market within a bull market. After this historic decade-long run, there are signs that enthusiasm could be waning. Investors have pulled money from the stock market so far this year. Citi's equity strategist Robert Buckland called stocks' 2019 rally a "flowless" one as the market shoots up despite a whopping $31 billion net outflows from equity funds. Buybacks, instead of investor inflows, are now driving the market, Buckland said. The December sell-off "was really jarring because everyone is aware how old this expansion is. Bull markets do not last forever. So any sign that the party is over and the bull market is ending really strikes fear in investors' minds because the last bad sell-off we went through was 10 years ago and it was a disaster. Even 10 years on, I think people definitely have not forgotten that," Essaye said. But if investors do start to buy in again, it could add momentum to the rally, Citi said. Some industry players think the market's bull run   after December's wipeout and could now carry on for an 11th year as the Fed turned more dovish. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Shares of   rebounded Friday after a report that the plane manufacturer plans to roll out a software upgrade for its 737 Max aircraft in 10 days. The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to sign off on Boeing's planned changes to its anti-stall software on March 25, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. Lawmakers have been informed of the timeline, the person said. The approval of the software change does not necessarily mean that the FAA's order to ground the planes will be lifted, added the person. French news agency Agence France-Presse, citing sources, earlier reported the time-frame for the fix. Boeing told CNBC the overall timeline has not changed. The FAA on Wednesday followed dozens of other countries in grounding Boeing 737 Max planes, citing possible links   in the past nine months. On Sunday, an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board. That came less than five months after the crash of a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 flight from Jakarta, Indonesia, which killed all 189 people on board. Both planes were new, delivered from Boeing just months before those flights. Boeing's stock fell more 10 percent this week in the aftermath of the Ethiopia crash. The plane manufacturer's shares rose roughly 3 percent Friday afternoon following the AFP report, and closed up 1.5 percent at $378.99. Investigators have indicated that the Lion Air pilots battled an automatic anti-stall system that comes with the 737 Max planes that wasn't included in older models. Before it grounded the Boeing 737 Max planes, the FAA had said it would mandate a software fix by April and said Boeing was developing other updates to pilot training and manuals. A weeks-long turnaround for Boeing would come much sooner than some on Wall Street had estimated. Bank of America   this week that it would take the aircraft manufacturer three to six months to "certify the fix."

     Keep Me Logged In The college admissions scandal that broke earlier this week has put the private equity firm TPG and one of its senior executives in a fight over whether he quit or was fired for cause. On Thursday evening, TPG emailed a statement to CNBC's   that said William McGlashan, who had been the head of its growth buyout fund, had been "terminated for cause." He had been on administrative leave since Tuesday, after he was charged in the nationwide scheme that involved parents bribing college coaches and arranging for falsified standardized test scores to gain admission for their children to several elite universities. "After reviewing the allegations of personal misconduct in the criminal complaint, we believe the behavior described to be inexcusable and antithetical to the values of our entire organization," TPG's statement said. Dozens of people have been charged  . But McGlashan is disputing the terms of his departure, saying he resigned. In an email to CNBC around the same time the firm sent its email, a spokesman for McGlashan said he has resigned from TPG's Rise Fund and TPG Thursday afternoon. "The progress we have made is too important for you to be distracted by the issues I am facing personally," said the text of a message from McGlashan to TPG board members that was forwarded in the spokesman's email. TPG Growth has invested in startups like Airbnb and Uber. McGlashan, a Yale and Stanford Business School graduate, also started the Rise Fund, which is aimed at investments that promote social good. The Rise Fund first launched with the musician Bono and raised $2 billion in 2017. The second iteration of the fund recently had its first close of fundraising, which brought in another $1 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Given the McGlashan's implication in the college bribery scandal, TPG has told investors that they will have the opportunity to "reaffirm" their commitments to the second Rise Fund, or pull their investment if they so choose, a person said. Prosecutors allege McGlashan paid $50,000 to the charitable arm of a college admissions counseling firm, which was going to correct his son's answers on a standardized test to boost the score. They also allege he arranged to fake an athletic profile of his son to help gain him admission to the University of Southern California. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Uber is reaching for a lofty valuation in its upcoming initial public offering. An expected $120 billion valuation for the ride-hailing company would make it more valuable than  ,  ,   and other established names that have been raking in profits for years. The 12-figure price-tag is a result of proposals from Wall Street banks and nearly double Uber's valuation from its last private fundraising in late 2018, The   reported in October. But Uber notably, is not making money. The Silicon Valley start-up has been mounting billion-dollar losses ahead of its highly anticipated market debut. Last year it managed to stem some of the bleeding. Its adjusted losses slowed by 15 percent, to $1.8 billion, according to Uber's self-reported financials published in February. In 2017, Uber lost $2.2 billion. The company increased its revenue, though at a slower pace than in the previous year. Full-year revenue last year was $11.3 billion, up 43 percent year over year. Its IPO plans are now neck-and-neck with rival Lyft, which released its long-awaited IPO prospectus in early March. That   showed a loss of $911 million on $2.1 billion in revenue last year for Lyft. Uber plans to release its S-1 filing and start an IPO road show in April, Reuters reported. Slack, Pinterest and Palantir also plan to go public in 2019. But tech companies are not known for making money ahead of public offerings. Twitter was losing money when it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2013. Snap, Spotify and SurveyMonkey — which all listed in 2018 — were also losing money. Market capitalization, or "market cap," is the total dollar amount of a company's outstanding shares. It can be calculated by multiplying the firm's outstanding shares by the price of one share. The market cap Uber reportedly wants also dwarfs those of major auto-manufacturers. General Motors is worth $53.8 billion while Ford has a market cap of $33.4 billion.  ,  ,   and   would also be one-upped by Uber's valuation. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Billionaire hedge fund manager   said  's decision to pull out of New York City is "heartbreaking," and the political climate "dramatically" reduced his interest in moving the headquarters of his financial firm to the city, according to  "I'm a bit frustrated by the political winds in the city over the last two months. Amazon opting out of New York is heartbreaking," Griffin said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. Griffin runs Citadel, a giant financial firm with vast trading operations and a hedge fund unit that manages more than $30 billion. Griffin told Bloomberg after the broadcast interview that Amazon's decision has been "a huge backtrack" in the company's internal planning and the political environment in New York has "dramatically" damped his interest in moving. "Because when you bring a firm that is such a great user of technology into your city, it's not just about the success story of Amazon, it's about the fact that you now have a tailed magnate that creates an entire ecosystem of success stories around it," he said on the TV interview. The billionaire investor said he has been debating making New York his primary home and moving Citadel from Chicago after buying   overlooking Central Park, the most expensive home ever sold in the U.S. "I'm actually in New York every single week ... we pay the New York investment banks roughly $1 billion a year in revenues. This is my second home in some sense ...The apartment presents the possibility that it might be home for me and Citadel could be headquartered in New York one day," Griffin said.

     Keep Me Logged In Rep.  , the California Democrat who runs the powerful House Financial Services Committee, called for the removal of Wells Fargo CEO   after news that he received a $2 million bonus as part of  . The San Francisco-based bank disclosed Sloan's compensation late Wednesday, revealing that the executive got a 5 percent increase in total pay to $18.4 million, including the $2 million bonus, for his work in 2018. "It is outrageous and wholly inappropriate that the bank has rewarded Mr. Sloan with a $2 million bonus for 2018," Waters said in an emailed statement. She pointed out that last year, "federal regulators and authorities capped the bank's growth and fined the bank more than $3 billion for offenses such as improperly charging customers auto insurance and mortgage fees." Waters, who grilled Sloan during a four-hour hearing into Wells Fargo's consumer abuse issues on Tuesday, has called for his removal before. Other politicians, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for president, have also called for Sloan to resign, and Wall Street analysts have speculated that Sloan's job may be in jeopardy. One bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said Tuesday that it "continued to be disappointed" with Wells Fargo's efforts on risk management and corporate governance. "It was very clear from Mr. Sloan's testimony that Wells Fargo has failed to clean up its act," Waters said. "Mr. Sloan shouldn't be getting a bonus, he should be shown the door."

     Keep Me Logged In  rush to pass a new foreign investment law on Friday is likely not enough to appease the demands of the U.S. in ongoing trade negotiations, analysts said. Beijing's largely symbolic   ended Friday with a ceremonial endorsement of a law that addresses specific issues the foreign business community has long complained about. The new rules prohibit the forced transfer of technology from foreign-invested businesses in China, step up protection of intellectual property and claim to give the companies equal footing with domestic players, according to publicly available materials. "It's trying to address some of the concerns that are being raised (in the trade talks)," Andrew McGinty, partner at law firm Hogan Lovells, said in a phone interview with CNBC on Friday. "'OK,' (China says,) 'We hear what you say. Here is a clear attempt to translate those concerns into legislation,'" McGinty said. "It's a step in the right direction. But the trade tensions are wider than that. They're historical." Following increasing frustration by foreign businesses about their ability to compete fairly with Chinese companies, the U.S. and China became embroiled in trade tensions last year. Under U.S. President  , the rhetoric about the spat initially focused on the American trade deficit with China. That resulted in the application of tariffs on $250 billion worth of imported goods from China, to which Beijing countered with duties on $110 billion worth of goods from the U.S. In the last several months, the negotiations between both sides have increasingly centered on issues of intellectual property protection and claims of forced technology transfer. Little detail about progress on the talks has been made public. On Friday, Chinese state media said leaders of both trade delegations held a phone call in the morning Beijing time and made "substantial progress." A few hours later, the symbolic gathering of delegates endorsed the new foreign investment law. It took just about three months from the time the NPC Standing Committee began soliciting comments on its first draft. "It's rushing this through," Lester Ross, chair of the policy committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said in a phone interview with CNBC on Thursday. "It's not giving this adequate time for public comment from AmCham (and foreign businesses).The law is drafted in a pretty general way." Ross also noted the draft gave China the right to retaliate against a particular country for restricting Chinese companies there. "The law offers a more broad-based retaliation," said Ross, who is also partner at law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. Such a clause essentially reinforces the unequal footing that foreign and Chinese companies have in accessing each others' countries. U.S. companies have complained that they get less access in China than Chinese companies have in America. But the Chinese government is clearly trying to show it has the interests of foreigners in mind. At the last minute, Beijing even added new language that provides further protection of foreign company commercial and trade secrets, according to a final draft reviewed by the U.S.-China Business Council. "The addition of language imposing criminal penalties for sharing sensitive foreign company information adopts a much tougher deterrent against counterfeiting and (intellectual property) theft and will offer new avenues for the enforcement of (intellectual property) protection," Jake Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said in a statement. He noted the council is "pleased" with the new language. He cautioned that "enforcement will be the key metric for evaluating success, but the business community has collectively advocated for years for the Chinese government to impose criminal penalties for (intellectual property) infringement, we need to recognize this positive progress to that end." The law is set to be implemented on Jan. 1, 2020. It's expected to abolish three existing regulations on equity joint ventures, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and contractual joint ventures, according to an  In all, for foreign businesses already eyeing opportunities to profit off the world's second-largest economy, the law does give them more incentive to enter China, Ross said: "It is moving in a good direction. It doesn't go nearly far enough." Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

The conclusion is that active managers continue to show dismal performance against their passive benchmarks. For the ninth consecutive year, the majority (64.49 percent) of large-cap funds lagged the S&P 500 last year. "The figures highlight that heightened market volatility does not necessarily result in better relative performance for active investing," the report said. "What's different about 2018 was the fourth quarter volatility," Aye M. Soe, a managing director at S&P and one of the authors of the report, told CNBC. "Active managers claimed that they would outperform during volatility, and it didn't happen." The study will bolster the claims of many financial advisors, who say that investing in low-cost, passive funds remains the soundest long-term investment. This is not a one-year phenomenon. S&P has been doing this study for 16 years, and the long-term results only strengthen the claims for index investing. Indeed, while a fund manager may outperform for a year or two, the outperformance does not persist. After 10 years, 85 percent of large cap funds underperformed the S&P 500, and after 15 years, nearly 92 percent are trailing the index. Long-term, the numbers were not much better in other categories like small-cap stocks or fixed income: "Over long-term horizons, 80 percent or more of active managers across all categories underperformed their respective benchmarks," the report concluded. Looking at managers' overall record last year versus the broader S&P 1500 Composite, 2018 was the fourth-worst year for stock managers since 2001. Critically, the study adjusts for "survivorship bias." Many funds are liquidated because of poor performance, so the survivors give the appearance the overall group is doing better than it really is. "The disappearance of funds remains meaningful," the report notes. Over 15 years, 57 percent of domestic equity funds and 52 percent of all fixed income funds were merged or liquidated. The S&P 500 is now at the highest level since early October after breaking through key resistance levels. Investing in low-cost, passive funds remains the soundest long-term investment. Boeing threatened to disrupt the market's climb, but there are a number of factors at play that are boosting stocks. Maybe it's time we all got more reasonable with future expectations in the stock market. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. and China will need to overcome significant hurdles in resolving long-term disagreements if they are to build on the momentum from the past week of trade talks. The United States is planning to delay a menu of additional Chinese tariffs that were scheduled to begin on March 1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on its best winning streak since 1995, but the 'godfather' of chart analysis, says a pullback is necessary before rallying further. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Telecommunications giant   rose 0.7 percent in the premarket Friday after an analyst at Raymond James upgraded the stock, noting it trades at a more attractive valuation than rival Verizon. Analyst Frank Louthan raised his rating on AT&T to outperform from market perform. He also issued a price target of $34 per share, which represents a 12.3 percent upside over the next 12 months. "The outlook for positive earnings growth combined with a strong de-levering story are likely to drive the shares to outperform," Louthan wrote in a note to clients. "AT&T trades at a discount to Verizon of ~3.5x turns of EPS and FCF, with 250 bp higher dividend yield. We believe that the combination of positive earnings growth and delivering over the course of the year will being investors back to AT&T." AT&T shares slumped in the last 12 months, falling more than 18 percent in that time period. Verizon, meanwhile, is up about 20 percent. AT&T was under pressure as it faced legal hurdles to close an $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner. The company also dealt with slowing customer growth. In the fourth quarter, the company added a net 134,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, well below estimates. AT&T's churn rate also rose to 1 percent last quarter from 0.89 percent in the year-earlier period. AT&T's streaming service, DirecTV Now, lost 267,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, more than was expected. The company said the attrition rate was mostly due to people leaving the service  . Moving forward, profits from DirecTV Now should increase, Louthan said: First, profitability of DIRECTVNOW should increase as costs are eliminated. Second, the product is now less attractive to a wider audience with limited content. While current users are able to keep the 105 channel package, it could be harder to attract new customers. We expect AT&T to offset this with a more complete lineup of channels from its delayed DTV OTT offering and its enhanced streaming service (likely bolted onto HBO GO), both expected later in 2019. He also said AT&T could outperform the broader telecom sector this year, with his earnings per share estimate for 2019 implying a return of 18 percent from current levels. "Where we could be wrong is if investors focus more on the subscriber metrics as they report over the course of the year (regardless of the EPS and FCF impact) and trade off that," Louthan said.

     Keep Me Logged In As much as  's latest economic data indicate a slowdown in growth, a look at seasonal factors — and air pollution levels — signals the deceleration could be more significant, analysts said. Data released Thursday showed China's industrial output fell from 5.7 percent in December to  . That was the slowest pace in 17 years, according to Reuters. Fixed-asset investment rose 6.1 percent and retail sales increased 8.2 percent, both mildly beating the expectations of analysts polled by Reuters. Economic reports for the year's first two months are often lumped together in China to account for the Lunar New Year holiday, which typically takes place in early February. As people visit family and friends, the nationwide business shutdown can dampen economic activity. This year, there may be other factors at play. "Due to the anti-pollution campaign in November 2017 and March 2018, activity data in January-February this year may have been inflated due (to) a low base," Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, and his team said in a Thursday report. The Chinese government is in the middle of a multi-year effort to reduce air pollution, which has enveloped major cities in unhealthy smog, especially during the winter months. However, cutting the amount of hazardous particles in the air requires less reliance on coal-burning factories, which could have a negative impact on economic growth in the short term. Anecdotally, in the southeastern part of China around Shanghai and Hangzhou, skies have been gloomy for much of the beginning of the year. "The Chinese government is seriously concerned about unemployment (first and foremost) and GDP growth,“ Junheng Li, founder of China-focused equity research firm JL Warren Capital, said in a note on Jan. 19. "We have witnessed first-hand that many factories that had shut down previously have now been reopened in the greater Shanghai metropolis, producing severe smog in the city almost daily — far worse than last year." In the north, Reuters analysis also found that   of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 during the latest winter anti-smog campaign beginning last October." The report said average concentrations of PM2.5 rose 13 percent over the period, and cited a government official last week as saying that, while weather was partly a factor, some localities wanted "a rest after years of hardship." The Chinese government has indicated it remains intent on cutting back pollution. Premier Li Keqiang said last week in his annual government work report that authorities will strengthen pollution prevention and control in the year ahead. At the same time, Li gave a lower economic growth target than last year, and said the  The economic outlook doesn't bode well. Nomura's Lu noted that pent-up demand in April and May of last year likely means the comparable year-on-year data on economic activity in the months ahead will be "negatively affected." Lu lowered his first-quarter gross domestic growth forecast to 6.2 percent growth from the year-ago period, and maintained a forecast of an even slower 5.7 percent growth rate for the second quarter. China's economy grew at 6.6 percent last year, according to official government data, which represented the slowest pace since 1990. Beijing says it is aiming for 6 to 6.5 percent growth this year. Analysts also pointed out that Thursday's data release indicated the majority of fixed-asset investment came from property, while spending growth in areas more critical to the economy was less robust: "(Thursday's) data is the third wake-up call to the market in six days, after   and  ," Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie, said Thursday in a report. "All of them point to strong growth headwinds ahead, which lays the ground for a choppy market like 2012 (earnings downward revision and multiple upward revision, left charts) instead of a bull market like 2017 (both earnings and multiple being revised up)." One of the few bright spots may be stabilization in retail sales, which Hu said he expects should grow at 8 percent this year, slightly below last year's 9 percent growth. The   fell 1.2 percent Thursday, and it's down more than 3.5 percent over the last five trading days. Still, the index is up 19.9 percent for the year so far. Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In Institutional Investor hall of famer Richard Bernstein believes too many tech investors are getting dangerously caught up in what could turn into another dot-com bust. According to Bernstein, emotions among individual investors are running too high and diverging from fundamentals. "We're at a point in the technology cycle where investors are starting to become pure momentum investors," the CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors said Wednesday on CNBC's " ." "You have this notion where people believe that tech is no longer cyclical. It's something new. It's something different. And, that's sounding a bit like March 2000." The dot-com bubble's demise began March 11, 2000. By Oct. 9, 2002, the tech-heavy   lost almost 80 percent of its value. Bernstein, a CNBC contributor and  , isn't concerned about runaway valuations creating another epic crash in the tech sector. Rather, he's worried investors are setting themselves up for disappointment by using a flawed way of thinking as  . "As profits decelerate, which most people are in agreement is going to happen this year, tech is generally one of the worst performing sectors," he said. Bernstein is attacking the slowdown proactively. In early January, he cut his tech exposure by more than half. Some may question the timing of the move. The Nasdaq is up more than 15 percent this year. However, he's standing by his strategy. "Whenever profits decelerate, the most important factor in a portfolio is quality and stability," Bernstein said.

     Keep Me Logged In Add Cowen to a list of   bulls as analysts there see the steady iPhone business driving the stock another 20 percent higher. Cowen initiated coverage on Apple with an outperform rating and $220 12-month price target. The firm said the iPhone business remains a strong driver for the stock and provides investors with an "annuity." "Does the iPhone business make Apple a trading stock or bond coupon? We think it's a bit of both," Cowen's Krish Sankar said in a note Thursday. "The company has a 900 million strong, loyal iPhone customer base globally to which it can offer a growing ecosystem of devices such as wearables and new content subscriptions and service offerings." "With the iPhone installed base at 900 million units and oldest devices approaching five years, we believe annual iPhone shipments are running near replacement demand," Sankar added. "The stock could be a good buy from a short-term trading standpoint as well." The iPhone business has actually been facing challenges as competition intensify in the mature market and Apple's overpricing its latest iPhone models has also drawn criticism. But Cowen believes that mature business offers investors a stable outlook of future cash flow for the next five years. With most devices needed to be replaced over that time period, that means annual shipments of 180 million can be counted on, the analyst said. The replacement sales offer a "potentially a supportive LT annuity for device sales." An annuity is a contract that promises investors a stream of income payments in the future. Apple has made back the losses in 2018 with the stock rebounding more than 15 percent year to date. Shares of Apple rose more than 1 percent on Thursday. Cowen is also bullish on Apple's services segment, estimating earnings from services to double in two years. "We see scope for further expansion with increased scale in content subscriptions and higher contributions from App Store and Licensing revenues," Sankar said. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Vodafone and Huawei have jointly built a superior 5G experience zone in Barcelona during MWC 2019. In this zone, Vodafone deployed 5G sites with commercial 5G spectrum to build a high-performance 5G network with Huawei's E2E products and solutions. Riding on this network, various eMBB services were provided using Huawei 5G commercial smartphones and CPEs to deliver the ultimate 5G service experience. The live networks were deployed in Barcelona City Center (Plaza Catalunya, Paseo de Gracia, Balmes and Universitat). Huawei's 5G E2E products and solutions were used to provide continuous live network coverage. Based on the spectrum of C-Band 80MHz, the downlink peak rate achieved was 1.7Gbps in the live 5G scenario, while the average geographical downlink throughput was about 800Mbps, enabling a genuine Gbps experience. Multiple gNodeBs (5G) were deployed at existing 4G LTE sites and provided the same coverage as that of the eNodeBs (4G LTE). This network performance proves that active antennas (massive MIMO) are the key to reduce the cost per bit for operators. With the combination of 64T64R and the 80 MHz bandwidth, compared with 4G LTE, 5G can increase the capacity of a single cell by 20-25 times and reduce the per bit traffic cost to 1/10. The coverage provided by active antennas makes 5G and 4G co-site construction possible, greatly reducing the cost of a new site. 5G eMBB is a turning point for user experience. It delivers a Gbps-level experience for smartphone users. The first 5G smartphone from Huawei was on display in the experience zone. This phone is the world's fastest foldable 5G phone. In Vodafone booth (Fira Hall 3) and Huawei booth (Hall 1 Back Garden), smartphones using 5G 80MHz spectrum were able to support super-fast video file download and play. The visual delay of the human eye is nearly 100 milliseconds (ms). The latency on a 5G network will be <20ms for consumers and can be even lower in certain enterprise applications like smart factories. With 5G, video service users can experience nearly zero wait. With the emergence and popularization of commercial terminals such as 5G smartphones and CPEs, the rapid development of 5G will provide more services for consumers and bring MBB to a new level. Santiago Tenorio, Vodafone's Group Head of Networks Strategy and Architecture, visited the experience zone and highly commended it. He remarked that it is a significant technical achievement by Vodafone and Huawei engineers to have incorporated the latest 5G standard into commercial technology so quickly. Vodafone is on track to have 5G networks ready for customers in some European cities in the second half of this year, he added. Yang Chaobin, President of Huawei's 5G Product Line, said, "Vodafone and Huawei have successfully completed the deployment of a live 5G network and provided a superior service experience based on 5G commercial terminals. Huawei will continue to work together with the industry to promote the successful commercial use of 5G."

     Keep Me Logged In It's a question asked in a foreboding tone when markets behave a certain way: "What does the bond market know that the stock market doesn't?" The market behavior that prompts this query is a decline in Treasury yields coinciding with rising stock prices, and it's what we're seeing so far this year. The 10-year Treasury is near its 2019 low of 2.60 percent, while the   is at its year-to-date high, up more than 12 percent. The conceit of the question is that receding bond yields are a signal of slowing economic growth, rising financial risks and waning risk appetites. If any combination of those forces is at work, then a steady climb in stock indexes would seem incongruous and perhaps ill-fated. Yet there are reasons to doubt that there's any inherent inconsistency or acute vulnerability to the market in the current trend of strong stocks and subdued yields. For one thing, there's nothing all that unusual about stock and bond prices rising together. (Yields move inversely to prices) It was the rule for most of the 1980s and '90s. And this relationship played out over previous phases of the current economic cycle. In 2014, the 10-year Treasury yield sank from 3 percent to 2.1 percent over the course of the year, and the S&P 500 gained more than 11 percent, posting new record highs. Likewise, over the course of 2017, when yields slanted lower as stocks had one of the gentlest ascents in memory, rising 20 percent with hardly any pullbacks. Then there's the fact that in recent months both stocks and bonds are pricing in a transparent and patient Federal Reserve, which is able to take this posture because inflation appears well-contained. This also is helping to compress volatility in both stocks and bonds, with the CBOE's equity volatility index below 14 at a five-month low. Taken together, slim bond yields, a gentle Fed and ebbing volatility tend to support or expand equity valuations, even with corporate profits seen going flat in the first half of the year. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, points out that the markets are responding in concert to an economy coming off a scare over potential overheating and a possible Fed mistake. "It is not that the bond market knows something the stock market doesn't," he argues. "Although Treasury yields often fall and remain lower at the start of a recession, they also frequently decline and remain lower when the valuation of stocks and bonds rise together. Rather than signaling a pending recession, recent action in the Treasury market more likely reflects the common aftermath of a mid-cycle overheat within an ongoing expansion." The kinds of stocks gaining favor also fit with a low-yield environment: dividend-rich utilities and real-estate investment trusts are near all-time highs. So is the  , which contains more stable companies rather than cyclically geared ones. And big growth stocks – those promising many years of expected rising cash flows to come – are leading again: The Russell 1000 growth index has outpaced its value counterpart by 1.5 percentage points in the past month. The 52-week high list from Wednesday speaks to this preference, featuring the likes of  ,  ,   and  . All this suggests that the market is not recklessly pricing in a big economic acceleration or earnings snapback that the bond market isn't. Equities are mostly recovering the nasty downside overshoot of December while investor sentiment and positioning have gradually returned toward a more neutral state. Low Treasury yields would be a bigger worry for stocks if the yield curve were flattening further, or if corporate bonds were being shunned. The Treasury yield curve has been narrow but steady this year, between 0.15 and 0.2 percentage points between the 2- and 10-year maturities. And the risk spreads on high-yield corporate debt have tightened up since December and are back toward November values, which is pretty consistent with the S&P 500 trading back up to early November levels. All of this helps explain how stocks have managed to rally while yields trend lower. But it doesn't answer the question of how long it can go on this way, or just how much further lift stocks can derive from a patient Fed and undemanding corporate-debt costs. Back in the first half of 2016, with global yields remaining quite low and a similar mix of dividend-centric and growth stocks carrying the market higher, the S&P traded up to a forward price/earnings multiple above 17, until profit forecasts finally bottomed and growth expectations picked up. Right now, the S&P 500 trades at 16.3-times forecast earnings for the next 12 months. The estimates for 2019 earnings are down a bit more than 7 percent since their October high, while the S&P 500 is off a bit more than 4 percent from its peak. One could argue that stocks have already given companies credit for weathering this profit slowdown and resuming growth later this year, with most of the projected improvement slated for the fourth quarter. At some point, soon or not, this could seem like an overly rosy outlook and perhaps then stocks would be on more fragile footing. But it won't be because the bond market now "knows" anything that's particularly scary. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In The software fix that   said it is working on for its 737 Max jets could take as long as six months, according to Bank of America. Boeing   a software change is in the works as well as updates to pilot manuals and training and the   said it would mandate those changes by April. "Once Boeing identifies the issue on the 737 MAX, the most likely scenario, in our view, is that the company will take about 3-6 months to come up with a fix and certify the fix," the bank's analyst, Ronald Epstein, said in a note Thursday. The FAA on Wednesday grounded all   737 Max jets in the U.S.,  . The turnaround came after dozens of countries grounded the planes, tanking the stock more than 11 percent this week, on pace to post its biggest weekly decline since 2008. Bank of America kept its buy rating and $480 price target on Boeing as the bank believes the investigation would have a "definitive timeline" as the recovery of the black boxes is already underway. This would significantly reduce the uncertainty around Boeing and the 737 Max model, the bank said. The two black boxes from the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed Sunday in Ethiopia   for investigation. "We would expect Boeing to continue to produce the 737 at the current rate of 52 per month in order to minimize disruption in the supply chain. Boeing may have to carry inventory in its balance sheet of about $5.5bn per quarter. We would expect working capital to improve as the aircraft begins delivery again," Epstein said. The bank predicts that the rentals Boeing would have to pay for alternative airlines would cost the company $500 million or 88 cents per share in the first quarter. Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In Sterling rose on Wednesday after  leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement. The   was up 2 percent against the dollar at $1.3339 as investors become more optimistic that a hard Brexit would be ruled out. That's the biggest move since April 2017. "Our base view — and the currency is telling you this — is we will get some form of resolution," said KKR's global head of macro and asset allocation Henry McVey on CNBC's  . "Clearly, there's been slowing related to Brexit. The way we're approaching it is this is going to be a slow-growing economy [with] low inflation." The rejection of a no-deal Brexit, passed with 312 votes to 278, set up another vote Thursday on whether its official departure date should be extended. The result was widely expected as most members of Parliament want to avoid the economic uncertainty and trade disruptions that it could cause. "Parliament has made it clear that unless there is a deal, they are not ready to leave the EU. Sterling traders are in love with this concept and this pushed the price of Sterling higher against the dollar," Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said in a note. WATCH:  Sterling extended its rally this year, posting its biggest gain since April 18, 2017 when the sterling gained 2.19 percent against the dollar. Infamously known as a "cliff-edge" Brexit, a no-deal exit would mean the U.K. abruptly ceases to be a member of the EU overnight on March 29. It would mean there would be no 21-month transition period in place to gently prepare for life outside the bloc it has belonged to for 46 years. It would also have to rely on WTO trading rules. The vote was seen as part of some concessions given to Parliament by Prime Minister Theresa May a few weeks ago and was only confirmed Tuesday when   for a second time. MPs will now vote again Thursday evening on whether to seek an extension to Article 50 (which oversees the departure process) thus extending the departure date beyond March 29. The EU would have to agree to this and the U.K. would have to give a good reason for requesting the delay. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Hiring prospects have worsened in  , recruitment firm ManpowerGroup found in its latest survey released Tuesday. A net 6 percent of firms surveyed plan to increase hiring between April and June — the lowest since the third quarter of 2017, the data showed. Tuesday's survey also showed a drop from the more optimistic 10 percent in the first quarter of this year, indicating that the brief pickup from a slowdown in 2018 has yet to prove its sustainability. More employers were uncertain about the next three months, with that number jumping to 43 percent from 19 percent in the prior quarter, the report said. The survey covered 4,209 companies of different sizes in China. A representative from Manpower in China was not available for comment on the report, which said second-quarter hiring plans were "conservative." Making sure people have jobs is a growing worry for the Chinese government as it tries to manage a slowing economy and cinch a trade deal with its biggest trade partner. During the opening of China's largely   last week, Premier Li Keqiang announced that ensuring employment would become a priority for national policy for the first time. At that meeting, Li also gave an   — slower than last year's 6.6 percent — and noted the negative impact from trade tensions with the U.S. Tariffs and uncertainty on trade have particularly hit some export-related companies in Guangdong,   in late February. He added that the government must make sure people have jobs in order to ensure social well-being and consumption, which is critical for the economy. Consumer spending now accounts for 76 percent of China's growth, according to official reports. However, consumers may be less willing to spend as uncertainty grows about their job security and wage growth. Companies in all nine regions of China planned to increase hiring, according to the survey. But the level of hiring intentions declined in seven of those regions, notably in Beijing and Shanghai. The report characterized the labor market in the capital city as "quiet" and said Shanghai “employers anticipate limited payroll gains." Shenzhen and Chengdu, both considered up-and-coming cities, also reported declines in the hiring outlook, the survey showed. The jobs outlook for the Central and West regions was unchanged, while the report said Guangzhou employers were the most optimistic on hiring. Among six industries, the mining and construction sector was the only one with a positive improvement in the outlook, compared with a year ago, the survey said. China's national unemployment rate officially remains relatively low, near 5 percent or less. Last week, the government announced it plans to target the creation of 11 million urban jobs and keep the survey-based urban unemployment rate around 5.5 percent. Finance Minister Liu Kun also said Beijing plans to spend 53.9 billion yuan ($8 billion) on employment subsidies this year, an increase of 14.9 percent. Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

     Keep Me Logged In Britain's biggest insurer,  , reported an above-forecast 6 percent rise in 2018 operating profit to 4.8 billion pounds ($6.31 billion) on Wednesday after a strong performance from its Asian business. The life insurer, which has large operations in Asia and the United States as well as Britain, was forecast to show operating profit of 4.6 billion pounds, according to a company-compiled forecast of analyst expectations. Prudential said it was making "continued progress" in separating its British business, M&G Prudential, through a stock market listing, which market sources expect before the end of the year. "Given the extent of our opportunities and our proven ability to execute and innovate, we are well positioned to continue to grow profitably," Chief Executive Mike Wells said in a statement. The firm's Asian business saw a 14 percent rise in operating profit while M&G Prudential's profit rose 19 percent, with its British pensions business helped by a slowdown in life improvement expectations. But the U.S. business, Jackson, lagged, with profit down 11 percent due to accounting measures related to lower U.S. stock markets. M&G Prudential saw net asset management outflows of 9.9 billion pounds from external clients, including the expected redemption of a 6.5 billion pound institutional mandate. Prudential's shares were trading at 15.40 pounds at 0904 GMT, up 0.6 percent, slightly outperforming the  . Prudential said it would pay a total dividend of 49.35 pence per share, up 5 percent but below a forecast 50.36 pence. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In As   builds out its web of branches across the U.S., it is launching into areas long dominated by two of its biggest rivals. J.P. Morgan is expanding into nine new U.S. markets as it fills gaps in its network of physical locations. Bank of America or Wells Fargo are a top lender in seven of those nine cities, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  . The new markets are Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina; Kansas City, Kansas; Minneapolis; Nashville, Tennessee; Pittsburgh; Providence, Rhode Island; and St. Louis. For instance, in Charlotte – where   has its global headquarters — the lender has 81 percent of the market and $158 billion in deposits, according to the FDIC. Wells Fargo ranks second place in Charlotte, but first in Raleigh and Greenville. "There's competition in every single one of these cities, whether it's from big banks or smaller ones," said Dan Deegan, J.P. Morgan's head of market expansion. The lender already has hundreds of thousands of retail and business customers in these markets through private banking, commercial banking and credit-card relationships, he said. As J.P. Morgan seeks to cover   of the U.S. population with branches by 2022, it is heightening a rivalry with the country's biggest banks. The lender announced in January 2018 that it planned to open 400 new branches over five years. Banks of all sizes – from behemoths like J.P. Morgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, to online-only offerings like Goldman Sachs' Marcus – are competing for deposits to fuel growth. J.P. Morgan said it will open 90 new branches this year, although most of those will be in the Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Boston areas, Deegan said. With Wednesday's moves, the bank has disclosed the majority of new markets it plans to enter, he said. About 30 percent of branches will be in low- to moderate-income areas, and the lender is planning to work with community groups on job training efforts, the bank said. Despite its expansion plans, J.P. Morgan has recently been winnowing the total numbers of branches as it shutters underperforming or redundant locations. The bank had   at the end of 2018, or about 2 percent fewer than the year earlier. And the bank makes it clear that when it comes to brick and mortar, it has options. It told investors last month it can shutter more than 75 percent of its branches within five years, or keep them open for more than a decade. Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

"There's no Trump boom. We're near the end of this cycle. Recessions haven't been outlawed. It will happen in the next year or two." It's a subject that's in his new book, "Peak Trump: The Undrainable Swamp and The Fantasy of MAGA." "We hit peak Trump and peak market at 2,940 on the S&P back in September. I think that's the peak for a long time to come, and I think Trump foolishly embraced the stock market," Stockman added. He sees the   plunging to 1,600 or lower — a more than 40 percent drop from current levels. For years, Stockman has been warning investors a sell-off of that magnitude is inevitable. Two years ago, he predicted a " " would hit stocks. It never happened. Last year, he called it a " ." Yet, he's unwavering in his bearish case. "We've got headwinds coming from all over the world, and you can see it in the export data, in the European economy, in the big troubles going on in China, [and] you can see it in our own data, which has been really weak," said Stockman. He also emphasizes the record budget deficit as an unnerving headwind. "It is a huge risk. I mean it's actually crazy time that this market and Washington, both ends of the Acela corridor, are totally ignoring," Stockman said. "We're going to go into a fiscal crisis in the 2020s when the entire baby boomers are retiring and Social Security and Medicare are soaring that we won't come out of. That's the big elephant in the room." According to Stockman, President Donald Trump's budget released this week reinforces and underscores how bad the deficit has gotten. "We should be having almost no deficit at the top of a business cycle," Stockman said. "We have a serious problem of unhinged central banking, and we have a Washington that has totally been euthanized by cheap yields on the debt. And, they pretend you can borrow $4 trillion at the top of a business cycle and live to tell about it." He contends a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war wouldn't alter his negative view. "The idea that somehow there is going to be a China deal and that will make everything better, I think, is laughable," Stockman said. Asked about Stockman's comments, White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said via email:  "Due to the President's pro growth policies the economy is booming. More people are employed today than previously were and more jobs are remaining on our shores. The President's budget calls for economic policies that drive down the deficit and continue to bring prosperity to all Americans."

However, Jonas remains doubtful that self-driving could be a reality anytime soon due to the technological and legal hurdles. "While GM Cruise is widely seen as a leader in AVs, we do not believe the human safety driver can be removed from any appreciable amount of fleet for many years... if not more than a decade," Jonas said.

     Keep Me Logged In Shares of a company selling short-term health insurance plans took a hit Wednesday after Congress members announced they were looking into the practice. House Democrats, led by Energy and Commerce Chairman Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., are requesting documents from 12 healthcare companies regarding reports of practices like denying coverage and deceiving consumers. "We are troubled that consumers who sign up for these plans are being misled about the nature of the coverage they are purchasing," the Congress members said in a press  . "Consumers are being denied coverage even for medical care that is rightfully covered under the terms of their contract, through a process known as post claims underwriting." The House members said they sent letters to companies they say may have denied coverage entirely, charged more based on age, gender or health state, or refused to cover consumers that had pre-existing conditions. Companies under the Congressional microscope either sell or assist consumers in signing Americans up for short-term limited-duration insurance, or STLDI. Shares of one of these companies —   — dropped sharply after the news, first reported by Politico. The Tampa, Florida-based company, which trades on the Nasdaq, offers life, critical illness, dental and other insurance products. Shares closed 17 percent lower Wednesday, but are still up more than 15 percent this year.  and   were also among the 12 letter recipients and closed the day slightly higher. Health care has been divisive issue for both sides of the aisle — especially since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Some Republicans have since moved to repeal the Obama administration's signature healthcare law, while several Democratic presidential candidates are embracing an even more expansive "Medicare-for-all" insurance plan to cover every American. Raymond James analyst Gregory Peters, who has an "outperform" rating on Health Insurance Innovations, said any investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats "should not come as a surprise." "We view the sell-off in the stock as an irrational overreaction with zero fundamental basis," Peters wrote in a note to clients Thursday. "The only policy threat to short term health plans is if a Democrat wins the White House in 2021."

     Keep Me Logged In  CEO   got a 5 percent pay raise for leading the troubled bank last year. The executive received $18.4 million, including a $2.4 million salary, $14 million in stock awards and $2 million in incentive awards, according to a regulatory filing. That compares to the $17.5 million he earned for 2017, which was a 36 percent increase from the previous year. Sloan, 58, took over the fourth-biggest U.S. bank in October 2016. Charged with cleaning up the fake-accounts scandal that claimed his predecessor, Sloan has struggled to satisfy regulators' demands to overhaul the sprawling institution. Last year, thanks to "widespread consumer abuses," the Federal Reserve capped the bank's asset growth after the bank found more problems with customer dealings.  Wells Fargo shares dropped 25 percent in 2018, under-performing its biggest rivals. During a four-hour long testimony this week before the House Financial Services committee, Sloan revealed that the bank was operating under 14 separate consent decrees with his regulators. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for president, has repeatedly called for Sloan to resign.  Meanwhile,   CEO Jamie Dimon received $31 million for his work last year, while Brian Moynihan of Bank of America got $26.5 million, and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman got $29 million.

     Keep Me Logged In PayPal users can now transfer money from the app to their bank accounts in real time. , parent company of peer-to-peer payments app Venmo, announced "Instant Transfer" on Tuesday for users who typically need to wait at least one business day for those funds to land in their bank. "We wanted to continue rolling out additional solutions that make it faster for people and businesses to get access to their money," PayPal Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready said in a blog post. The new function is a result of a   with  . Through that relationship, PayPal is able to access the Real Time Payments network from The Clearing House and enable those transfers immediately. The instant-transfer feature is already rolling out to PayPal customers in the U.S., and should be available to businesses in coming weeks with international expansion "expected in the near future," according to PayPal. Venmo users will get the function "in the near future." The company began offering instant deposit for debit cards two years ago. Growth in that product, along with "Funds Now," another way for businesses to instantly access cash, spurred the need for the instant transfer function, Ready said. "The technology has gotten faster but in many ways money access has gotten slower, which is perplexing in many ways," Ready told CNBC's " " on Tuesday. "With this, you can now spend that right away when you get paid." Ready said Tuesday's announcement should be more meaningful for small businesses, which don't always have a debit card linked to their account. PayPal has been continuously moving into more traditional areas of banking like lending to small businesses. It and other tech companies are becoming increasingly popular   for borrowers who want to cut down on paperwork and access funds more quickly. "Getting faster access to money is becoming more and more critical for most people, especially as the global workforce is evolving and an increase in less traditional and more entrepreneurial jobs means people have potentially less stable and more variable incomes," said Ready, former CEO of Braintree, which originally acquired Venmo. PayPal later acquired BrainTree in 2013, bringing Venmo under the PayPal umbrella. Despite its bank-like offerings, PayPal is not FDIC-insured like one. It has money-transmitter licenses across different states and partners with The Bancorp Bank, which holds customers' deposits. The partnership model is a   setup for fintech companies that don't have their own bank charter. The company did not say whether it would charge a premium for the instant deposit function. Standard Venmo transfers to a bank, which take about a day, are free. Venmo has been a bright spot for the payments company. PayPal saw $19 billion in payments volume through Venmo in the fourth quarter — an 80 percent increase year over year. The fintech company is on track to do another $100 billion in payment volume through Venmo this year. But the app has yet to break even and start making money for its parent company. That monetization effort has been a major focus for Wall Street analysts that cover PayPal. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Chinese interest in  's iPhone seems to be waning as fewer consumers search for the smart phone online, according to Longbow Research. The number of iPhone searches on Chinese search engine   plummeted 48 percent in February, slightly less than the 50 percent plunge in January, Longbow said. It was the fifth consecutive month of decline. The lackluster search trends came even after  . "Multiple iPhone price cuts did not stop China iPhone search trends from weakening further while February supplier sales were abysmal," Longbow analyst Shawn Harrison said in a note Tuesday. Baidu iPhone search trends are indicative of iPhone demand, according to the firm. It said they have a 74 percent correlation to changes in Apple's year-over-year sales in China during the past four years. The searches also have an 82 percent correlation to iPhone shipments into China, Longbow said. Apple's iPhone sales in China decreased 5 percent year over year in February and more than 30 percent from January, Longbow said. The firm kept its neutral rating for Apple and expects earnings of $11 per share in fiscal year of 2019. "We remain neutral since without iPhone demand acceleration on the horizon, we currently do not see any catalysts near term to drive significant EPS upside," Harrison said.  on Monday announced   where streaming TV and subscription news services are expected. Shares of the iPhone maker have gained more than 13 percent in 2019. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In 's entry into TV streaming will be a game changer, according to Wedbush Securities. The tech giant on Monday announced   March 25 where it is widely expected to unveil its TV streaming services that will offer iPhone and iPad owners access to  along with other streaming services. Wedbush is particularly bullish on Apple's move into streaming, estimating 100 million users in just three years. "We think it's a potential game changer," Wedbush tech analyst Daniel Ives said on CNBC's " " on Tuesday. "We think 100 million subs they can get in the next three years." "It's a shot across the bow of Cook to Hastings [Entertainment] and others that Apple's here for streaming," he added. Given Apple's "massive installed base and unmatched brand loyalty," reaching the 100 million subscription number is "a realistic goal," Ives said in a note earlier Tuesday. The new subscription could translate into a $7 billion to $10 billion annual revenue stream over time for Apple and a $215 per share valuation for the stock in a bull-case scenario, Ives wrote. Shares of the iPhone maker gained more than 1 percent in Tuesday trading, adding to a gain of nearly 15 percent year to date. Ives said the streaming services will be worth about $400 billion for Apple and this "highly profitable" segment is poised to bring in $50 billion in revenue by 2020. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In After a stellar rebound,   still thinks stocks are in a bear market. "The stock market was and still is in a bear market," the founder and chief executive officer of Doubleline Capital said in an investor webcast on Tuesday. He also said stocks could go negative again in 2019. The market dipped into bear market territory on Christmas Eve when it dropped dropping 20 percent from its 52-week high. Stocks have since staged a strong comeback from the massive December sell-off with the   gaining nearly 19 percent from Christmas Eve low and more than 11 percent year to date. Gundlach credited the market rebound to the "180-degree turn" from the Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently signaled a "patient" approach to rate hikes and said the central bank is   balance sheet unwind if needed. The Fed chief rattled investors in December when he described the balance sheet roll-off as being on "autopilot." But the weakening economic data from the U.S. are sending bearish signals. Gundlach, in the webcast, highlighted the deteriorating hard and soft data and the collapse in December retail sales. The so-called bond king and respected prognosticator on financial markets oversees $120 billion of assets under management. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Huawei is committed to bringing digital transformation to every person, home, and organization to create a fully connected, intelligent world. But before Huawei can digitalize the industry and society-at-large, the company must first transform itself into a fully connected, smart enterprise — and to achieve this, it has decided to prioritize its own digital transformation for the next five years. By accomplishing 'Digital First' — the process of becoming fully connected and smart — Huawei hopes to create new industry benchmarks for efficiency, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. The crucial question for every modern enterprise is, "Why undergo digital transformation?" First and foremost, the fourth industrial revolution is upon us, and digital production using data processing tools such as ICT platforms, software, and services is becoming a common practice across all businesses. With the expectation that profound changes will impact every aspect of society, digitalization is spawning new business opportunities and revenue sources. Low operational efficiency and high operating costs are the business challenges of our time; and so far, advancements in robotics and other forms of mechanical automation have been unable to solve all operational bottlenecks throughout an organization. But digital technology in the form of shared data pools   eventually solve these problems and allow enterprises to simultaneously optimize products, experiences, and costs. When businesses discuss digital transformation, the discussion often begins with a focus on technology. However, based on years of experience, Huawei has determined that the transformation solution requires a combination of technology and business that simultaneously aligns business fundamentals and creates value for customers and users. Digital transformation is a two-line V-model. The Customer-Business-Architecture (CBA) line is focused on the customer as the driver of business and architectural improvements. The AI + Big data + Cloud (ABC) line is focused on unified cloud platforms as the foundation for deployed solutions. Huawei has designed its digital transformation architecture around five objectives: First, deepen connectivity to achieve user satisfaction by building one-stop service experiences for five different types of users: enterprise customers, consumers, partners, suppliers, and Huawei employees. Its aim is build service platforms that link our customers, end-users, partners, and development teams with the equipment and knowledge necessary to fulfill their goals in one-stop. Second, provide flexible and fast service orchestration support for global operations based on real-world operating scenarios. Huawei established a future direction for transformation that analyzed each of the company's independent service scenarios, including open interfaces to support flexible scheduling for service personnel. For example, Huawei now provides standardized IT equipment and services to mobile phone retailers globally in order to enable rapid store openings. Third, establish a general platform for digital transformation that supports service growth. In order to better support digital transformation across all domains, Huawei has created a public IT platform that provides more than 600 services in four service categories (basic, platform, application, and security). In 2018, Huawei increased its adoption of AI technology, particularly in the company's high frequency, complex, large scale operating scenarios — turning dumb processes into intelligent ones. Today, there are more than 200 examples of AI applications in use at Huawei, and demand for similar services will continue well into the future. Fourth, build Real-time, Open, Multi-cloud, and Agile (ROMA) management capabilities for internal and external interconnections and interoperability. Connectivity is the core foundation for accomplishing digital transformation for traditional, non-cloud enterprises. This is why Huawei has built ROMA capabilities to secure external corporate boundaries to quickly introduce existing, mature services into multi-cloud environments. Fifth, build an 'Operation Command Platform + Cavalry' for real-time operations. To better prepare for the future, Huawei is revamping its entire operating system to create a real-time, intelligent command platform. The ultimate goal is the creation of a full-service, full-scenario operations center that provides service monitoring and alerts, process coordination, event scheduling, and forecasting to support its digital transformation and service development. After undertaking its own digital transformation, Huawei is in the position to provide valuable insight to enterprises hoping to start their own transformation process. , 'Digital First' is a business transition that should be led by the business division. , a digital transformation is a top-level project that requires firm strategic determination and decisive action once a direction is chosen. , companies must build a ROADS (Real-time, On-demand, All-online, DIY, Social) experience driven by customer and end-user needs. , you need to build a two-line V-model of business and digital technology that aligns with your business while creating more value for your customers and end-users. , aim high, but start low. Create a blueprint and a systematic design. Start by identifying the enterprise's real problems, find breakthroughs, and resolve single issues before trying to cover all areas. , digital transformations cannot be achieved in a single stroke. Choose a direction, keep innovating, and respond with speed and flexibility. Huawei is a leading global provider of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and smart devices. With integrated solutions across four key domains – telecom networks, IT, smart devices, and cloud services – we are committed to bringing digital to every person, home and organization for a fully connected, intelligent world. Huawei's end-to-end portfolio of products, solutions and services are both competitive and secure. Through open collaboration with ecosystem partners, we create lasting value for our customers, working to empower people, enrich home life, and inspire innovation in organizations of all shapes and sizes. At Huawei, innovation focuses on customer needs. We invest heavily in basic research, concentrating on technological breakthroughs that drive the world forward. We have more than 180,000 employees, and we operate in more than 170 countries and regions. Founded in 1987, Huawei is a private company fully owned by its employees. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In One fund is going a step further in the race to zero-fee ETFs by paying investors to put money into its new exchange traded fund. Salt Financial filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday to introduce an ETF that will temporarily pay people to invest for at least the first year. The less-than two-year-old firm already runs a $10 million ETF called the Salt High Trubeta US Market ETF ( ). Salt's plan comes in an increasingly competitive ETF backdrop with thousands of options. Incumbents like  , Vanguard and   have continued to slash fees, while new entrants like Social Financial, which is the lending site called SoFi, have   out at zero. This week, J.P. Morgan   its lowest-fee ETF yet, with a 0.02 percent fee. BlackRock's iShares and Charles Schwab had been the lowest for broad U.S. equity exposure at 0.03 percent fees each, while Vanguard Group's broad U.S. stock market ETF charges 0.04 percent. Salt's rate is temporary, though, and the kickbacks are small. The firm has pledged to pay 0.05 percent of assets to the ETF but only on the first $100 million under management until April 2020. For example, investors will get 50 cents back on every $1,000 sitting in the fund. Once the fund grows to $100 million, the cash-kickback will be capped and shared with buyers. Once the ETF passes that April 2020 date or crosses the $100 million level, whichever comes first, it will charge 0.29 percent. Salt Financial's Low TruBeta US Market ETF, which would trade under the ticker "LSLT" plans to track an index of about 100 low-volatility stocks. Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, said that fact that the Salt High truBeta US Market Fund has attracted only $10 million since launching last May, at a fee of 29 basis points, helps explain the decision on the new ETF. Any ETF that can't gather $100 million or more will not show up on the screens of most investors and financial advisors, or make it onto brokerage platforms. "It shows the challenges they face getting more money in the door. It highlights how aggressive asset managers need to be. The bar keeps moving lower," Rosenbluth said. "This can help to get them over the hump of $100 million." ETFs with fees as low as 10 basis points have recently shut down for lack of investor interest. Firms have been forced to differentiate. "When SoFi came out with plans for the zero-fee ETF I said, 'If you're going to crash an ETF party dominated by a handful of firms you need to make a splash,'" he said. "I thought zero-fee was how to make a splash, but the bar has moved lower." Ben Johnson, director of passive strategies for North America at Morningstar Research Services, noted in a tweet on Tuesday that  's plan to launch a core U.S. stock ETF at two basis points would save an investor with $10,000 already in a three-basis point ETF all of $1 a year. Salt Financial's filing indicates that the new ETF will track an index it creates, and self-indexing can save fund issuers money, which is more important when fees are low, or in this case, negative. But that also means investors are tracking an index that is not from a major index company, like the S&P 500. An index can deviate from the S&P 500 by a significant amount — either outperforming or under-performing — and that deviation can be greater than the fee differential versus other funds. Investors need to have confidence they will be on the right side of that performance deviation to be confident that the lower fee is the most important factor in selecting an ETF. "Investors should want to understand what they are owning. A good deal is not the same as an appropriate investment," Rosenbluth said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In The so-called bond king   is not shy when it come to rebuking the increasingly popular theory backed by progressives — the Modern Monetary Theory. "MMT is a crackpot idea... sounds good for a first grader," the founder and chief executive officer of Doubleline Capital said in an investor webcast on Tuesday. He said the theory is "complete nonsense" being used to justify a socialist program. The notion behind MMT is that as long as the Federal Reserve can keep interest rates low without sparking inflation, the national debt and budget deficit won't be an issue. MMT has been espoused by politicians including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Gundlach added that the "ridiculous" MMT is a way of monetizing and could lead to "a significant boycott of long-term bonds" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently said  . "The idea that deficits don't matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong," Powell said during congressional testimony in the Senate. Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In The economic weakness outside the U.S. is about to pose a big threat to U.S. companies. Those international-oriented companies, with more than half of their sales generated overseas, are expected to see an earnings decline of 11.2 percent in the first quarter of 2019, according to FactSet. That is significantly lower than the earnings estimates for the   and for domestic-oriented companies. Wall Street is projecting a 3.4 percent earnings loss for the S&P 500, while seeing 1 percent growth for companies with more than half of their sales coming from the U.S., according to FactSet. "The U.S. economy seems stable, but an international slowdown eventually could spill over to the U.S.," Scott Wren, Wells Fargo's senior global equity strategist said in a note. "International trade and forward-looking economic data still are weakening, particularly in Europe. China's growth should stabilize, but its economic stimulus probably cannot lift the whole world economy." Stocks have staged a strong comeback in 2019 but the economic weakness across the globe is starting to derail a market that has rallied more than 10 percent this year. The market posted its biggest weekly decline in 2019 last week after the European Central Bank   for 2019 and announced   to help banks in the region. A   also added to growing concerns on the global slowdown. Executives from many companies have voiced concerns about the effects of slowing demand overseas and a global economic slowdown, leading some to cut earnings guidance. According to FactSet, 74 percent of companies have issued negative EPS guidance, which is above the five-year average of 71 percent. Things are worrisome across the globe. The Bank of Canada said Wednesday there was "  " around future rate hikes, while Australia's fourth-quarter GDP expanded at a pace of just 0.2 percent. Amid the ongoing trade negotiations, China set its economic growth target for 2019 between 6 percent and 6.5 percent, its slowest pace since 1990. Federal Reserve Chairman   echoed the worries in an interview that aired Sunday  when he said the economy is still strong, but weakness around the world could start to hit the U.S. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Brexit has shattered the U.K.'s image as a place for investment, the former chairman of one of the country's biggest banks said Monday. A second referendum on whether the U.K. should leave the EU may be inevitable, Gerald Grimstone, who served as chairman of Barclays, warned ahead of crucial Parliament votes this week on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal. And he didn't mince his words. "Brexit is completely unpredictable for the U.K. ... I think it's been an unmitigated disaster for the U.K., and in the short term, it's made the U.K. almost uninvestable," Grimstone told CNBC's Dan Murphy at the Global Financial Forum in Dubai Monday. "We have two contrasting scenarios before us, and nobody knows which way we're going to go." Only 18 days before the U.K.'s scheduled departure from the EU on March 29, the prime minister is trying, and so far failing, to get concessions from EU leaders on the exit deal  . This will be the second vote on the deal, after it suffered a punishing defeat in January. If a simple majority of them don't approve the deal, they are then due to vote on whether they want to leave the 28-member bloc  . If this is also refused,  (which sets out the departure process) and delay Britain's departure. May  But EU officials have so far offered May little relief, with both sides expressing increasing frustration at what they see as continued deadlock. Some politicians and business players have  , who's already survived two votes of no confidence from lawmakers in her own party and from the opposition. The former Barclays chair stressed the urgent need for the U.K. to make up its mind on what Brexit will actually look like. "I've got huge respect for PM May, but they didn't get the politics right," he said. "The country is going to have to make a choice at some point, either in the single market, or out." It's time for a drastic change, Grimstone said — and that may mean a second public vote on Brexit, something that many "remain" lawmakers, as well as several business leaders, have called for. "I think a second vote is almost unavoidable," he said. "That vote might come through a general election and/or a second referendum. You cannot have a scenario where the government of the day is putting legislation through the Parliament and that legislation fails... If a government can't get its legislation through Parliament, there will have to be a change of characters in the Parliament." Many international companies are   of the U.K. as uncertainty reigns over the fate of the country and its status in relation to the EU. And British firms have   due to Brexit, a report from the London School of Economics revealed last month. EU businesses have cut their spending in Britain, leading to losses for the U.K. of more than $13 billion to date, and the report said that figure may rise. Consulting firm EY found that   in assets out of the U.K., and one study found that   in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Still, a number of global firms continue to show confidence in the U.K., with major investments for new offices and headquarters coming into London from the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook. As for the pound, forecasters are divided — it could either soar or  , experts say. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Most of the earnings growth expected at megabanks this year hinges on one thing: stock buybacks. That's what happens with an industry that's throwing off billions of dollars in profit and is well-capitalized compared with historical levels and yet faces limited growth opportunities, according to a recent note from KBW analysts led by Fred Cannon. The impact is greatest at the biggest banks, which generate the most earnings and are held to the highest standards for capital. For instance, at banks like  , about 63 percent of the median expected earnings per share growth in 2019 is tied to share repurchases, according to the note. Without repurchases, which reduce the total number of shares outstanding, EPS growth would be far below the already-modest 4.4 percent median forecast for that group, KBW said. Smaller banks are more likely to use their capital for loan growth than for stock repurchases. At large regional lenders, 34 percent of earnings growth this year will be thanks to buybacks. At smaller firms, 25 percent of earnings growth is linked to repurchases. Both are expected to increase their earnings faster than the megabanks.  Big banks' reliance on share repurchases could be a hot-button topic ahead of the 2020 elections. Politicians from Sens.   and   to Marco Rubio support   that restrict or tax corporate share repurchases. The knock on buybacks is that wealthy investors benefit most from them, and that corporations should be spending more on employees or pursuing investment and growth opportunities.  After the Trump administration slashed taxes on corporations, American companies spent a record   on share repurchases last year. Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

     Keep Me Logged In President  's budget proposal unveiled on Monday would slash funding for the U.S. Education Department by more than 10 percent. The plan, titled " ," requests $62 billion for the Department of Education, or $7.1 billion less than the agency's allowance in 2019. The budget eliminates subsidized student debt, in which interest doesn't accrue on the loans while borrowers are in school or in economic hardship. It also reduces the number of repayment plans for borrowers and scratches the  , public service loan forgiveness program. "We have also reaffirmed our commitment to spending taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently by consolidating or eliminating duplicative and ineffective federal programs,"   U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The plan would narrow the numerous income-driven repayment plans, which caps people's monthly bills at a percentage of their income, to just one. Under that option, students' payments would be limited to 12.5 percent of their discretionary income, compared with 10 percent now. Any remaining debt would be canceled after 15 years for undergraduate students, and 30 years for graduate students. The federal work study program, which provides part-time jobs for undergraduate and graduate students with financial need, would also face cuts. Pell Grants would be expanded to cover short-term training programs,  . "As college remains more crucial for economic opportunity than ever before and costs continue to rise, these proposals move in the exact opposite direction that students and our economy need," said James Kvaal, the president of The Institute for College Access & Success. The public service loan forgiveness program is eliminated in the proposed budget. That program, signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007, allows not-for-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years of on-time payments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates that up to one-quarter of American workers could be eligible. "Eliminating public service loan forgiveness will hurt members of the U.S. Armed Forces, police, fire, EMTs and other first responders," said Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of SavingForCollege.com. "It will also reduce the number of people pursuing careers in public interest law, such as public defenders and prosecutors." Congress has rejected Trump's previous budget proposals to cut funding for the Education Department. Now that the House is controlled by Democrats, the administration may only find it harder to realize its requests.   Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In One Wall Street firm sees major upside for Facebook if its secretive cryptocurrency plan works out. The social network is   developing a cryptocurrency that could be part of a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity, Barclays internet analyst Ross Sandler said in a note to clients Monday. Sandler forecasted as much as $19 billion in additional revenue by 2021 from "Facebook Coin." Conservatively, the firm sees a base-case of an incremental $3 billion in revenue from a successful cryptocurrency implementation. "Merely establishing this revenue stream starts to change the story for Facebook shares in our view," Sandler said.  is reportedly developing a cryptocurrency for global payments that will be tied to the value of traditional currencies and available to use through its messenger "WhatsApp," according to Bloomberg and The New York Times. Facebook has not publicly commented on the reports. Price volatility has been one major roadblock to   widespread adoption as an everyday payment option. But Facebook's digital currency, a "stable coin," would likely be less attractive to speculators because of its fixed price tied to a currency like the U.S. dollar. Facebook's current business model came under fire from consumers, politicians and advertisers last year. Its share price tanked after a series of  . For one, British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica collected data on more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission. Still, Facebook earnings have continued to increase, and the share price has rallied roughly 30 percent this year. Expanding into payments could give Facebook a lifeline if investors suddenly become less forgiving. Using some form of cryptocurrency could generate a new revenue option — something "sorely needed at this stage of the company's narrative," Sandler said. "Any attempt to build out revenue streams outside of advertising, especially those that don't abuse user privacy are likely to be well-received by Facebook's shareholders," Sandler said. Barclays based its Facebook revenue estimates off of Google's digital distribution service, which is also the official app store for Android's operating system. "Google Play," as it's called, generates $6 in "net" revenue per user now. Facebook could see a "similar cadence," across its nearly 3 billion users in 2021. A Facebook virtual currency would allow for more premium content to find its way back to Facebook, Sandler said, as companies re-establish themselves on the social network as a strategic partner. Sandler pointed to Facebook's original payment ambitions almost a decade ago. The Menlo Park, California-based company created a virtual currency in 2010 called "Facebook credits," similar to modern-day cryptocurrency. Users would prepay for these virtual coins using domestic currencies, and then use those credits for in-app-purchases. The company required a user to pay using a debit or credit card upfront, and each virtual credit cost about 10 cents. The major problem, according to Sandler, was that Facebook had to bear the interchange cost, "which negatively impacts the profitability of the business, especially when making high volumes of lower-value transactions." Since then, Facebook and the cryptocurrency sector have matured. The company has a much larger user base, and more mega-apps like Instagram and WhatsApp to which it can distribute content. The company's new cryptocurrency plan could potentially "re-invigorate that business strategy," Sandler said. "Based on our checks, the first version of Facebook Coin may be a single purpose coin for micro-payments and domestic p2p money transfer (in-country), very similar to the original credits from 2010 and Venmo today," Sandler said. The scope of this project, according to Sandler, is larger than those previous ambitions. He pointed to the leader of Facebook's blockchain and cryptocurrency efforts — former PayPal President David Marcus. Facebook has been steadily building out its blockchain team, recently hiring a group of employees from start-up Chainspace. Challenges remain. Facebook needs to demonstrate a value proposition for users "above what is available today in payments" and build trust after its laundry list of issues in 2018, Sandler said. Global payments systems also tend to bring more regulatory scrutiny. But if the stable coin is successful, Sandler said, he sees no reason why Facebook couldn't get into consumer lending, remittance and physical payments "eventually." Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In The stock market correction likely isn't over, and evidence is mounting that there is more downside risk ahead for investors, according to Morgan Stanley. The investment bank projected that full-year earnings per share forecasts for   companies are likely to further fall between 4 percent and 5 percent, which could put added pressure on the index. The S&P 500 has gained more than 17 percent since hitting a 52-week low on Christmas Eve, boosted by   and signs that the Federal Reserve will   on any future interest rate hikes. But forecasts for 2019 S&P 500 earnings per share growth are already down 6 percent from their peak in September, and Morgan Stanley thinks investors aren't out of the woods yet. "Earnings revision breadth has been some of the worst we have ever witnessed with both sales and margin guidance coming down across all sectors," Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, Michael Wilson, said in a note. "The earnings recession is real and broader than the one we experienced in 2015-2016. It's also happening at a time when the economy has much less slack." Beginning in mid-2015, corporate profits among S&P 500 companies shrunk for five consecutive quarters. During that period, the index suffered two 10 percent corrections, set off in large part due to plunging oil prices. Earnings are expected to contract in the first quarter of this year, and, while a small increase is expected for the coming quarter, Wilson worries margin pressures could lead to more disappointment ahead as the year drags on. Just last month, Wilson   to 1 percent from 4.3 percent based on the many downward profit revisions during the fourth-quarter reporting season. Two recent economic data points last week amplified those concerns. Job cuts surged in February to the highest monthly total since July 2015, followed up by U.S. government  . Nonfarm payrolls increased by just 20,000 in February — the worst month for job creation since September 2017. "We think it is likely this gets worse before it gets better given the downward adjustment to earnings forecasts we expect," Wilson said. In addition to those weak indicators, a build-up in inventories — due in part to companies adjusting to the Trump administration's 10 percent tariff on $200 billion in Chinese goods — could further weigh on growth.  , for example, reportedly stopped ordering products from many of its wholesale vendors over the past two weeks — a sign the e-commerce giant could be moving to reduce inventory costs. Thousands of vendors could be impacted by that decision alone, and, given Amazon's size, it could adversely affect macroeconomic data. Wilson added that, in light of these concerns, Morgan Stanley is shifting its focus from cyclical stocks to defensive stocks. The bank recently downgraded the energy sector to "equal-weight," citing expected further declines in earnings forecasts. Recent data suggests that economic weakness outside the U.S. could pose  . Those international-facing companies, generating more than half of their sales overseas, are expected to see an earnings decline of 11.2 percent in the first quarter of 2019, according to FactSet. That is significantly lower than the earnings estimates for the S&P 500 and for domestic-oriented companies. Wall Street is projecting a 3.4 percent earnings loss for the S&P 500, while seeing 1 percent growth for companies with more than half of their sales coming from the U.S., according to FactSet.

"We went through the dotcom bubble bursting, the credit crisis and other extreme periods of time, and ETFs have continued to grow," Dan Draper told CNBC's  . Critics of ETFs say they can lead to increased volatility. Jack Bogle, the late founder of The Vanguard Group, said most of the trading in ETFs was done by " ." Draper maintains, however, investors are now "looking at things like quality and low volatility," particularly when investing in the  . Draper made his comments on the day the QQQ ETF, a widely followed exchange-traded fund, turned 20 years old. The ETF, which is commonly referred to as "the Qs," was launched in 1999 during the height of the dotcom bubble. In that time, the Qs are up more than 200 percent, outperforming the   — which tracks the broad index — by more than 100 percentage points. The Qs were quickly adopted as a proxy for big tech given its exposure to large-cap stocks in the space. The fund's largest holdings by weight are  ,  ,  ,   and  . Those five stocks alone make up more than 40 percent of the Qs in terms of weight. But Draper said it can be used for more than tracking tech. "It is a proxy for growth in the U.S. in particular. It's not just technology, but consumer areas as well as biotechs," he said. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In  reported a quarterly loss and forecast 2019 revenue and EBITDA below Wall Street estimates amid intensifying competition from fast-growing do-it-yourself home security offerings such as   Nest. ADT's shares fell more than 10 percent in after-hours trading. Security products such as Google Nest, SimpliSafe and Frontpoint can be self-installed, have a lower monthly fee and may or may not be monitored by a third party. These products compete with ADT's Pulse, which allows users to monitor and manage their home remotely. ADT's 2019 free cash flow growth forecast of 6 percent to 13 percent was a sharp deceleration from the more than 33 percent growth in 2018, as the company invests $40 million this year in initiatives such as branding to counter competition and hiring staff to expand its business. "We will make selective brand investments and we continue to solidify ADT's position as the leader in home automation and security," Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Likosar said on a conference call. ADT has expanded its home security and commercial security offering through acquisitions over the past few months. The company bought do-it-yourself home security provider Lifeshield for about $25 million in February and purchased Advanced Cabling Systems — a provider of fire alarm and video surveillance systems — in January. ADT said it expects 2019 revenue in a range of $4.90 billion to $5.10 billion, largely below the average analyst estimate of $4.92 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company's full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) outlook of between $2.46 billion and $2.50 billion was also below Wall Street expectations of $2.56 billion. ADT reported a net loss of $149 million, or 20 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $638 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a benefit due to the U.S. tax reform. ADT took a goodwill impairment charge of $88 million in 2018 due to underperformance of its Canadian business. Revenue rose 7.1 to $1.19 billion. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Don't expect a significant boost to stocks if and when the U.S. and China strike a deal on trade, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said Friday. Stopping the trade spat from turning into a true trade war "is clearly a positive. I think the market would rally on the news of that," Gorman said during an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations. But "would it be a meaningful rally? I'd be very surprised." Gorman made his comments after President   told reporters earlier in the day that he thinks a "very big spike" will take place in the stock market once a trade deal is reached. Stocks are up sharply this year in part because of increasing expectations for a U.S.-China trade deal. Since the start of the year, the   is up more than 8 percent. However, stocks have struggled this week partially due to worries that most positive news on trade was already priced into the market. "I think the market has been observing the trade talks for a while. I think there will be some deal involving some set of victories on some sheets of paper, some warm hearts and handshakes, but the fundamental challenges on global trade will not be resolved in the next days, weeks or even months," Gorman said. "These are multi-decade issues." Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Earlier this week at the Barclays Center, 74 men and 1 woman got the chance to live out a dream — they became professional competitive gamers. The esports athletes were officially drafted for the second season of Take-Two's NBA 2K League, the gaming giant's esports league featuring their flagship NBA 2K sports video game franchise. Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick emphasized the excitement surrounding the league's second season, highlighting the popularity and rising importance of the esports industry as a whole. "The first season ended with a great result, and everyone's looking forward to the April second tip-off," he said Friday on CNBC's "Fast Money." "Over 250 million people worldwide consume esports as a form of entertainment. About half of them, 125 million, are avid esports watchers." According to research firm Newzoo, esports is projected to generate $1.1 billion in revenue in 2019, marking the first year the industry would reach the billion-dollar mark. In many ways this year's NBA 2K League embodies how quickly the space is growing. AT&T is joining the likes of Dell and Intel as a partner for the league, which has also expanded to 21 teams from the original 17 NBA franchise-owned teams that hit the virtual court during last year's inaugural season. This year's draft pool also included 22 international players from outside of the U.S., reflecting the overall industry's drive to expand globally. Among the players in the draft pool was Chiquita Evans from Chicago, who became the league's first female player in a time when the esports industry as a whole is grappling with discussions around diversity and inclusion. Ultimately, Zelnick believes that esports leagues like NBA 2K will boost the video game industry as a whole. "We're having a record year with NBA 2K, so one of the things we love is that when there's more hits in the market, there are more people engaged and the entire market grows," he said. "So we're going to sell more units of NBA 2K this year than ever before, we'll have higher recurrent consumer spending than ever before." But the biggest gaming companies are facing stiff competition. While Take-Two and Activision Blizzard have dove into esports, with Blizzard's Overwatch League being the latter's most recent investment in the space, they're still facing the likes of other publishers who have dominated the industry. For example, Tencent-owned Riot Games' "League of Legends" events still draw huge numbers of viewers, with last year's World Championship finals attracting nearly 100 million unique viewers who watched the match (for comparison, this year's Super Bowl had 98 million viewers). This while Epic Games' "Fortnite" also continues to dominate online viewership, both recreational and competitively. Zelnick, however, believes that those same competitors, like "Fortnite," lift the games industry as a whole. "We think that 'Fortnite' is a great thing for the industry, it has probably brought in a somewhat younger consumer," he explained. "I'm often asked if it's something that has hurt us. To the contrary, we've seen the market continue to grow at the same time that 'Fortnite' has been an extraordinary hit for Epic." This despite the fact that some analysts believe game revenues could be set to decline. Back in January, London-based research firm owner Pelham Smithers forecast that video game revenue is headed for its first decline since 1995 on the back of tightening regulations in China, a shortage of big console hits in 2019 and waning player enthusiasm for battle royale titles like "Fortnite." But Smithers also made his predictions before the release of Electronic Arts' "Apex Legends," which took the gaming world by storm and garnered 50 million players in just one month. The battle royale title is yet another name in the free-to-play ecosystem that has revolutionized the gaming industry in the last few years, allowing users to download a game at no cost. In this case, the vast majority of revenue is made through in-game purchases and microtransactions, which have become dominant sources of earnings for many publishers. This has led even the biggest publishers to explore in-game monetization. Zelnick notes that not only have microtransactions become the "biggest opportunity" to encourage users to continue interacting with a title, but it ultimately is the biggest measure of engagement. "Microtransactions is spending, and that's a reflection in our view of engagement," he said, adding that they often are a result of "making the highest quality enttertainment" that "[engages] the customer." "If we get that right, monetization follows, revenues follow and profits follow, and that's been our story for the 11 years that we've been responsible for this enterprise," he added. Additionally, the Chinese government has seemingly eased on their game approval regulations. After freezing game approvals for months last year in a content crackdown on gaming companies, Chinese regulators have since approved 80 new games in January and one more for gaming giant Tencent in late February. Despite the games industry's growth, Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive have struggled with both stocks down 9 and 15 percent respective this year. Thanks to its "Apex Legends" sensation, Electronic Arts has outperformed its competitors and surged 25 percent. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Invesco's Kristina Hooper believes Wall Street's preoccupation with the global growth slowdown is misguided. But she understands why there's worry. According to Hooper, significant shifts in central banks' monetary policies are fanning those fears instead of giving the market confidence. She suggests it's creating more questions than answers — and that's a problem. "I don't think the slowdown is going to be that bad as we sit here today, and certainly that's not what we got from the ECB [European Central Bank] in terms of their downgrade of growth forecasts," the firm's chief global market strategist said Thursday on CNBC's " ." "We're not seeing any kind of major turmoil at this point." The latest shift came last week when the ECB   and issued a warning about the "threat of protectionism." "Don't forget that just a few months ago we heard from Jay Powell saying that balance sheet normalization would remain on autopilot. He changed rather dramatically," said Hooper. "Now that we have the European Central Bank piling on, that raises questions about what's going on. What are central banks worried about that is causing them to make rather dramatic pivots?" Despite the Street's negative reaction to the latest ECB's growth comments, Hooper isn't alarmed. "Investors that have a long-term time horizon should use this as an opportunity," she said. She sees emerging markets catching a bid from more accommodative central bank policies. Hooper particularly likes emerging markets in Asia and China is a big piece of that  . "China is employing a lot of stimulus both monetary and fiscal," said Hooper. "We could actually see signs of some improvement in economic data in China."

     Keep Me Logged In Federal Reserve Chairman   said in an interview aired Sunday that he does not think he can be fired by President  . While continuing to avoid direct comment on the president's withering criticism of central bank interest rate policy, Powell told CBS' "60 Minutes" that Trump can't remove him from office. "The law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it," Powell told the news magazine show. Asked directly if he thought Trump could fire him, he said, "no." A series of interest rate hikes in 2018 drew the president's wrath, even though he nominated Powell to the Fed position after choosing not to put up former Chair   for a second term. The Fed under Powell unanimously approved four rate hikes in 2018, continuing a move toward policy normalization that Yellen began in December 2015. Trump has said the rate hikes are the biggest threat to U.S. growth. During that period, the U.S. saw its best economic gains in a recovery that began in mid-2009. GDP rose nearly 3 percent for the year, though most economists see that cooling off in the years ahead. In that regard, Powell reiterated the Fed's recently stated position that it can be patient when it comes to the future path of the policy as it watches the incoming data.  , helping to ratify concerns that the first quarter will show little, if any, economic growth. Powell said that the Fed, while likely on hold for a while, will be making its policy decisions based on the data and not on political considerations. "We are directed to execute policy in a strictly nonpolitical way, serving all Americans, and that's what we do," he said. "We are independent in that sense." Powell told "60 Minutes" anchor Scott Pelley that he thinks the economy is still strong, though he acknowledged that weakness around the world could start to hit the U.S. "I would say there's no reason why this economy cannot continue to expand," he said.

     Keep Me Logged In London continues to remain lucrative for bankers despite the uncertainty over the country's withdrawal from the EU. Data published from human resources firm Emolument, which analyzed 4,475 salaries and bonuses from front-office bankers (traders) working in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan, found that the U.K. capital was the most rewarding in terms of pay. "If London banks were to move their workforce to other European cities, average compensation packages would decrease. From analyst to MD (managing director), London offers the highest salaries and bonuses in the market," Emolument said in its findings, which was first published last year but is regularly updated. Different countries have different remuneration structures. In Paris, bonuses can account for as much as 49 percent of a banker's total compensation, according to Emolument, with a managing director's bonus being approximately £153,000 ($200,254) out of a total £312,000 compensation package. Frankfurt can pay lower bonuses but have higher base salaries. For example a vice president at a bank can get £108,000 in Frankfurt compared to £90,000 in Paris, Emolument said. "The numbers (salary) are good in London and for me personally, it is a lucrative business when dealing with clients. Moving out of here would mean the risk of losing key clients to other players on the street. When you lose business, you lose money too," one banker told CNBC on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the subject. They added that base salaries in London were better due to it being the traditional financial heart of Europe. "If we lose that status, then salaries could come down a bit." Emolument also surveyed nearly more than 1,000 executives working in these cities on how they feel about their workplace. While Frankfurt made it to the top of the charts for best work-life balance, Paris was the worst. The chart below outlines the results. Government officials and policymakers from these European cities have been lobbying banks to shift bases to their region. Speaking to CNBC last week, Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria said Milan is in the race to become a financial capital. "Milan is already the main center for government bond trading. As soon as Italy's financial system strengthens, Milan can become a top financial center. Obviously, this also depends on the general condition of the country," Tria said. The southern European nation fell into a technical recession in the last quarter of 2018 and the economy is currently dealing with the second-highest debt pile in the euro area — at about 130 percent of its debt-to-gross domestic product. . U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a crunch series of votes this week that will determine the immediate course of the U.K.'s withdrawal and future relationship with the EU. Even since the U.K. voted to leave, many banks have been contemplating some sort of a move to the continent. Slow client activity and concerns around a potential no-deal Brexit are likely to have sharpened those thoughts. "The uncertainty of what type of Brexit we're going to get has definitely muted a lot of the clients' appetite which has had a knock-on effect on the volume of business. A lot of people are on the fence. So yes, less volume/ less revenue will impact compensation," Joseph Leung, the founder and managing partner at recruitment firm Aubreck Leung, told CNBC earlier this month.

Boeing has by far the biggest influence on the Dow given the index is price weighted. In other words, a higher share price will have a greater impact on the Dow. Boeing's outsized influence over the Dow could be seen by looking at the index's counterparts, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq traded more than 1 percent higher while the Dow was up 0.79 percent. In other words, the Dow would be much higher if not for the aerospace giant's drop. Boeing closed at $422.54 per share on Friday. However, the stock closed at $400.01 on Monday and fell as low as $365.55 after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. The plane used for that flight was a 737 MAX 8 jet, one of Boeing's top-selling airplanes. The crash raised concern over the model's safety as it comes  . Several countries, including  , have grounded all flights involving the aircraft. "We anticipate heightened volatility in Boeing shares," Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said in a note to clients. "Though it is early to draw conclusions, there may be concerns of disruption around safety, production, groundings, and/or costs, all of which should be manageable longer-term."

     Keep Me Logged In Shares of   and   surged Monday after reports that the two have agreed to hold merger talks.  over the weekend suggested Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing had dropped his opposition to the deal. Sewing was reportedly forced to reconsider his stance following investor pressure over the bank's declining performance. The German government, which still owns 15 percent of Commerzbank, is understood to be backing a tie-up between the country's two largest lenders. Reuters reported that Berlin is pushing for a deal, even though it could cause a multi-billion euro financial hole, because it would force the re-valuation of the lenders' assets. Deutsche shares were up by over 2 percent in early deals Monday, while Commerzbank was up nearly 4 percent. Over a 12-month period, shares of both companies are down by around 40 percent. A banking industry source with knowledge of the matter, who preferred to remain anonymous, told CNBC there's not massive support for the merger within Deutsche Bank. "The general feeling is that the merger is not a great idea since Commerzbank doesn't have the same amount of credibility on the street as Deutsche Bank when it comes to clients and this can impact future trades." Another concern is the German government's stake in Commerzbank. "There is skepticism that a merger could mean a bigger say from the government in (the) bank's dealings," the source added. A spokeswoman from Commerzbank declined to comment. Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. However, both the companies declined to comment on the merger of a prospect to Reuters.  Reports of the possible merger have garnered reaction from across the industry, with some cautioning against the move. "I am not too optimistic on the merger synergies. There is some room but I don't think it will have any major impact on stock prices of either banks because it's still to be proven that there are synergies. The situation is still very fluid," Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon Asset Management, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday. "First of all, there is no sound economic reason from my perspective. There is no immediate need as there is no concern of the liquidity position ... And therefore it all boils down to whether you could create a strong bank out of the two," he said. Huenseler added that if a merger becomes more concrete it could give a boost to both company's shares, but said there would be no great benefit in the long or medium term. Meanwhile, the former chairman of Barclays, Gerry Grimstone told CNBC Monday that it would require a lot of "hard work" in putting together these two big banks. "I think Germany probably wants a banking champion, but gosh, putting two big banks together is hard work," Grimstone told CNBC's Dan Murphy in Dubai. "It's good for the competition. I think you need strong banks. If it's going to make it a strong bank it makes sense. But as I said before these aren't easy things to get right." Speculation about a merger has been rife for months, heightening under the tenure of German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken out in favor of strong lenders for the European nation. Both banks have struggled to return to sustainable profitability since the global financial crisis. While the government has made no official statement on the potential merger, speaking to CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said he is willing to lend "political support" to Deutsche Bank in its recovery path. "  ... suffered some setbacks in the past, but it is basically sound and it can recover and so the question is what are the details of such strategy. And as we discussed with the CEO and the board and all the people concerned, I trust in Deutsche Bank and I will lend my political support to Deutsche Bank, " he said. In the past few years, Deutsche Bank has made headlines for all the wrong reasons — from settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice, to management reshuffles, weak earnings, constant restructuring and steep stock price falls. Sewing, the bank's current CEO who took the helm in April 2018, has been making efforts to turn around the bank's ailing strategy. Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

     Keep Me Logged In In an economic slowdown, investors should look to companies with above-average sales growth because the rest of the market is weighed down by rising costs, according to Goldman Sachs. The bank built a portfolio of 50 stocks in the   with the fastest expected 2019 sales growth based on consensus estimates. The median constituent is expected to increase sales by 10 percent in 2019, versus just 4 percent for the average S&P 500 stock. The portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 by 4 percentage points this year. "In a market characterized by modest, sales-driven EPS growth, investors typically reward firms with the fastest expected top-line growth," Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note. Fewer companies are able to generate additional sales growth on the heels of a global economic slowdown as slowing demand and rising costs put pressure on companies. Wall Street analysts have been aggressive when it comes to slashing their earnings expectations. The estimates for the S&P 500′s first-quarter earnings have dropped 6.5 percent in the first two months of 2019 alone, the largest cut since the first quarter in 2016, according to FactSet. Analysts now are projecting an earnings loss of 3.2 percent in the first quarter and a gain of 4.1 percent for 2019.  is the stock with the highest expected 2019 sales growth in Goldman's basket, with the Street seeing a 28 percent revenue expansion this year.

Keep Me Logged In The change from atoms to bits is irrevocable and unstoppable.” It’s been over 20 years since Nicholas Negroponte made that claim in his groundbreaking book, Being Digital. He was describing the process of digitalization, making the point that atoms are the essential building blocks of the physical world, while bits are those of the virtual. Back then, the first wave of digitalization was often applied to media. Vinyl records gave way to Compact Discs which ultimately became mp3s — music became nothing more than digital information. Today, the process of digitalization is well underway. Our music, photos, documents — practically everything — are completely digital. The next phase has become known as digital transformation (DX), whereby companies completely adopt digital technologies, like the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), artificial intelligence (AI) or digital twins throughout their operation. The promise of DX is to create new value, which can take the shape of new work processes, products and services, or even new business models. Incorporating DX can help a company gain an edge over competitors, as it increases efficiency and profitability across the enterprise. In reality, when DX is attempted by companies with existing complex systems and which are run by actual human beings, it becomes clear that DX is as much of a leadership and mental challenge as a technological one. It requires a change in culture and mindset and can’t be done without the right people and partners. o see some of benefits of DX, we can look at the process industry, which includes everything from food and beverage to chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Within the process industry, digital technologies can be applied to automate more and more operations, optimize supply chains, realize smart manufacturing (using data and analytics throughout a manufacturing process) and improve the decision making process. These improvements open up new possibilities and often lead to entirely new business models and offerings. Access to new information and the automation of previously manual tasks bring about a change of mindset within the organization. All of these aspects have a real economic benefit thanks to things such as cost savings from predictive maintenance, higher human productivity and the lower cost of operations due to optimization. McKinsey & Co predicts that by 2025 the economic impact of DX will be as high as US$3.7 trillion for all manufacturing industries. Business leaders already recognize the need for change. A recent study of 116 corporate executives across 18 countries by SAP, showed that 90% think DX is important for their company’s overall business strategies. And according to IDG, 37% of organizations “have already started integrating and executing a digital-first approach.” Once the decision has been made, what next? Again, we can look to the process industry. As an example KLS Sharma, who literally wrote the book on industrial process automation, described the benefits of DX this way: [It] helps companies exploit the potentials hidden in their supply chain by streamlining processes, increase data transparency, and allowing for better and quicker decision making. New ideas and concepts are developing around IT-OT, providing major opportunities to leverage IT know-how to the production floor. This can make a difference when competing with peers. Yokogawa, a leader in advanced industrial instruments, automated control technology, and digital control and data analysis solutions, has garnered extensive expertise in the Industrial Automation business and supports their customers on a long-term basis not only to digitize data on the shop floor, but also to understand and utilize this data for enhanced performance in business operations. Yokogawa’s specialty in gathering data goes all the way back to the company’s founding in 1915, when they began making electric meters. That tradition has continued to include all sorts of accurate sensor and calibration equipment — from optical wavelength meters to process gas chromatographs. But gathering data is not enough; it needs to be analyzed to provide insights, and that’s a shortcoming of most companies today. Many have not yet reached the stage where they can make sense of the large amount of data they have collected. This is where partnerships with Yokogawa, can bring a multitude of benefits. They know where the data is coming from and how to utilize it to the best advantage. By working closely with their clients, Yokogawa discovers their needs. For example, when fluctuations in demand and prices were seen in the oil and gas sector, companies were pressured to limit capital expenditures. Improving plant operational efficiency by maximizing existing assets therefore became more and more important. Yokogawa helped their oil & gas clients adapt by employing new digital technology to save money on equipment through predictive and prescriptive maintenance approaches. In this case, IIoT was one of the ways to achieve DX. The existence of the IIoT solution led to new work process and business models. For example, remote pump diagnostics, which saves money by reducing the amount of time spent traveling and servicing industrial pumps, and “compressed-air-as-a-service,” which would not be possible without DX keeping the cost of maintaining air compressors low. In general, the proliferation and reduced cost of IT and digital technologies has moved from the enterprise level to the shop-floor. On the path “from atoms to bits,” everything within the process industry — people, services, supply chains, data — is becoming connected and integrated. The myriad connections are similar to those of neurons in the human brain, leading Yokogawa to dub the process “Synaptic Business Automation.” “Synaptic Business Automation is Yokogawa’s unique Industrial Automation (IA) business concept. Because it encompasses the entire business, and not just one part, it is able to help the company evolve and adapt. It allows all the different aspects of the company to work together in the most efficient and optimized way, so it can continue to add value and become competitive in a sustainable way.” If a company can truly digitalize, it can make the operation more resilient because it improves the ability to manage risk. Breakdowns can be predicted and prevented. Health and safety can be improved, and complex compliance regimes can be better managed. In a production plant, the digitalization of plant data, combined with deep knowledge of how they affect plant performance, allows for the optimization of production. But perhaps the greatest benefit of DX is the generation of business innovation. Business innovation refers to creating new sources of value and completely new business models. New business models are so important because DX is not just a strategy for a single company — it is a world-wide trend. A company’s competitors, suppliers, vendors — event their customers — are all going through their own DX. The future is inherently unpredictable. If you aren’t looking for ways to collaborate and co-create new business models that synch with the rest of the world, you are taking a risk. n one study by SAP, when business leaders were asked if their employees had the necessary skills to carry out DX, only 15% said yes. This lack of in-house expertise is a large barrier to many companies. In fact, it is very difficult for any single company to undertake DX by themselves. That’s why it is so important to work with the right partner. According to The Everest Group, 81% of top companies used third-party services to gain access to innovation. And it seems executives are ready for it. Bain & Company found that, 59% of executives were open to the idea of spurring innovation by “collaborating with outsiders, even competitors.” The support and flexibility at the executive level is key. DX also requires a reform of corporate culture. McKinsey found that, in companies with successful transformations, senior managers were more involved, they did their best to ensure collaboration across their organizations, and they encouraged their employees to experiment. This spirit of collaboration is exactly what Yokogawa brings to their DX partners. Co-innovation is their calling card. Their expertise goes back decades in automated and digital control technology such as IT-OT, data analysis solutions, and domain / business knowledge of Industrial Automation business. Identifying which stage of DX their client is at, Yokogawa integrates these applications and technologies in line with their client’s aims, and becomes a trusted partner in journey to achieve digital transformation.

     Keep Me Logged In Global investing maven Mark Mobius had unforgiving words for the U.K.'s leadership ahead of  Speaking to CNBC at the Global Financial Forum in Dubai, the asset management mogul said it was Prime Minister Theresa May's time to depart. "I think May has got to go," Mobius, founder of emerging markets fund Mobius Capital Partners, said Monday. "I think she doesn't have the leadership capability. You've got to have somebody who is going to be willing to say what she thinks, personally, and lead and say 'Look, I don't believe in Brexit, and we should change." "I definitely think she's against Brexit — she was in the beginning. I'm sure now it's even more." Indeed, the embattled prime minister quietly supported remaining in the European Union before the June 2016 Brexit vote, warning of adverse effects to the U.K.'s economy, security and even its union with Scotland. Since becoming head of government, however, she has pledged to "honor the results of the referendum," reiterating that "Brexit means Brexit." The U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29. "It's a mess. Why doesn't she come out and say 'I'm against this, I think it's a bad idea, these are the reasons, this is how it's going to affect us?'" Mobius asked, adding that he expected the pound to weaken after   Some experts say the pound could drop as much as   in the event of a no-deal Brexit. May has survived near-mutinies after members of her Conservative Party and later opposition party lawmakers held separate votes of no-confidence in her leadership, but she suffered a crushing defeat of her painstakingly negotiated Brexit deal with EU leaders in January. On Tuesday,  . If a simple majority doesn't approve the deal, lawmakers will then vote on whether Britain should leave the 28-member bloc  . A no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for the U.K. economy and spill over to international markets, a wide consensus of economists and business leaders have warned. If parliament members vote against a "no-deal" Brexit,   (which sets out the departure process) and delay Britain's March 29 departure. Experts are divided over the likely outcome of Tuesday's vote, with a large proportion of those surveyed by CNBC   by two to three months. May   in the deal to allay the concerns of U.K. lawmakers, who are primarily focused on  . It was designed to ensure that should Britain and the EU fail to resolve their future trading arrangements, there can be no possibility of a physical border being erected within the island of Ireland. The EU has kept a firm stand, offering only reassurances that the backstop is seen by European officials as a last resort.  On Sunday, British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said that Brexit could be reversed if lawmakers reject the government's exit deal. This came after two major euroskeptic factions in parliament warned that Mobius is one of the vast array of investors and market moguls criticizing the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU and its politicians' subsequent leadership. Speaking to CNBC in February,   slammed what he called the "irresponsibility" of the U.K.'s leaders, saying that "Brexit is an immediate problem, and it's a problem that's quite frankly annoying every private sector organization in the world today." — Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In February's employment report is expected to show strong job and wage growth, and could signal that the economy's slower growth in the first quarter is just a speed bump rather than a sign of trouble. The economy was expected to have added 180,000 jobs in February, and unemployment is expected to drop by a tenth to 3.9 percent. That is well below the   but economists still expect a solid report. Wage growth is expected to strengthen, rising 0.3 percent, up from January's 0.1 percent. "Jobs growth is the single best indicator of how the economy is doing. It shows both how many people are being added to payrolls. It tells you much people are being paid, and also any job that is added is a sign of strength of a company's order book and their prospects going forward," said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. He expects to see 200,000 jobs were added. The first quarter appears to be much slower than the fourth quarter, but economists are still frustrated by the lack of data, which was delayed by the government shutdown. For instance, January's retail sales will be released on Monday, much later than normal. That number is particularly important after the sharp surprising drop in December retail sales. "We expect 200,000 [jobs], a little stronger than consensus," said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. "The view is that job growth should slow because economic activity is starting to slow. We don't think 750,000 jobs over the last three months of the year is the trend. We do think things will slow down to 175,000 in the coming months. We're thinking growth slows from the 2.5 that we saw in the fourth quarter to about 2 percent at the end of the year." Many economists see growth of less than 2 percent in the first quarter but a bounce back in the second quarter as the economy shakes off the effects of the 35-day government shutdown and bad winter weather. The economy could also move beyond the drag from trade issues later in the year if there is a trade agreement between the U.S. and China and an end to tariffs. "Within the labor market, the biggest story is firms are looking to hire, and they're really just restricted by the low unemployment rate and being able to find people...With that dynamic, we still think the labor market looks strong. They're going to hire everyone they can," said Tilley. Goldman Sachs economists are less optimistic about February's job growth, and expect only 150,000 jobs, the slowest pace in five months. "We believe the trend in job growth has likely slowed from the 232k average pace of the last six months, and we also expect a drag of at least 40k from above-average snowfall during the February survey week," they wrote in a note. The Goldman economists said February seasonal factors have also become a negative, possibly because of unusually mild weather in recent years. "If so, this would also restrain payroll growth in tomorrow's report," they added. Tilley said he is watching to see if jobs were added in technology, and would expect them to be particularly in software and cloud computing. He noted that the fourth quarter GDP report showed a jump in spending in intellectual property and software by companies, with IP the strongest since the 1990s. Playing Share this video...

According to Focus magazine, Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing and his counterpart at Commerzbank, Martin Zielke, have been in intense talks for some days. Both managers have been given a mandate to hold talks by their management and supervisory boards, Focus said. Speculation of a merger has heightened under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken in favor of strong banks. Both banks have been slow to return to sustainable profitability since the global financial crisis. Last week, a person familiar with the matter said that U.S. investor Cerberus Capital Management, a major shareholder in both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, is open to a merger between the two lenders, raising the chances of a tie-up. Deutsche Bank, regarded as one of the most important banks for the global financial system, has been plagued by three years of losses, ratings downgrades, failed stress tests, and money laundering scandals. Commerzbank is still partially owned by the German government after a bailout. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In  pinned a poll to its Twitter account asking what its employees should wear to work now that the investment bank has relaxed its dress code. The winning choice? "Hoodie & sneakers" at 38 percent. But "suit" came in a solid second place at 28 percent. Least popular was "midtown uniform," a look so ubiquitous that it has its own Instagram   . The tongue-in-cheek poll pointed to a question gripping workplaces in an era when business casual — whatever that means — has become so accepted that even the most buttoned-up symbol of Wall Street power has surrendered to it. The 150-year-old company sent an internal memo this week announcing the time was right "to move to firmwide flexible dress code" while urging its 36,000 employees to "exercise good judgment in this regard." "It can be pretty scary because what is acceptable and what is appropriate to wear to work is not an easy question to answer. A suit? That's easy," said Chris Bossola, CEO of the Need Supply, a clothing and lifestyle store based in Richmond, Va. The drift toward relaxed workplaces began 1990s when companies started introducing "casual Fridays," said Robert Burke, CEO of Robert Burke Associates, a retail and fashion consulting firm. It rapidly became entrenched with the rise of West Coast tech giants like   and   and their young moguls. "Goldman was one of the last holdouts of a more formal dress code," Burke said. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's famous go-to outfit — jeans and a gray T-shirt — projects the confidence of the founder of a company that upended how people interact and companies advertise. It was when he wore a blue suit to a congressional hearing last year that observers said he looked diminished as lawmakers grilled him over Facebook's privacy policies. The episode was a vivid reminder that jeans won't do in every setting. But Wall Street firms have had to get with the program as they compete with tech giants for young workers comfortable with ditching the suit and tie in most professional settings. Goldman Sachs first relaxed its dress code for its technology and digital division employees in 2017. Expanding the policy to the rest of its workforce, Goldman cited its "one firm philosophy and the changing nature of workplaces." The change comes three years after the country's largest bank,  , adopted its own firmwide flexible dress policy. The dress code is symbolic of a deeper cultural transformation at financial firms, which are trying to project themselves as innovation hubs where individuality and autonomy is emphasized. Goldman, which says one-quarter of its employees work in engineering-related roles, has in-house incubator to allow employees to develop ideas. J.P. Morgan Chase has plans to open a financial technology campus in California's Bay Area. The tone has been set from the top. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who likes to emphasize his side gig as a DJ, has been known to show up tieless at formal events, as have the chief executives of JP Morgan Chase and  . Of course, the business casual conversation often centers around men, probably because finance remains male-dominated at the top levels. Men held nearly 80 percent of senior level and executive positions in U.S. investment banking and securities dealing in 2015, according to research compiled by Catalyst, an organization the promotes women in the workplace. Women have also long faced a more complicated calculation then men when it comes to workplace attire. Jennifer Hyman, CEO of Rent the Runway, reminded Goldman Sachs of that in a tweet that gently needled the investment for its male-centric poll. That gave Goldman Sachs the chance to tout its own efforts help women out sartorially: The investment firm put a Rent the Runway drop-off box at its Manhattan headquarters just last month. So, what constitutes acceptable professional attire these days? "This is pretty much what we wear," said Ed Silhan, a chief revenue officer for an advertising tech firm, who was wearing black jeans and boots in downtown Manhattan. "Flips, or playground sneakers — I'd stay away from that. You know, beat-up Nikes that you play basketball with. Just look presentable." Four years ago,   admonished its staff not to wear jeans, flip-flops or T-shirts at its London headquarters. Goldman Sachs exhorted its employees to keep its "broad and diverse client base around the world" in mind when deciding what to wear, as did J.P. Morgan Chase when it slackened its rules three years ago. The "midtown uniform" — slacks, button-downed shirt and fleece vest — has become something of a refuge for men trying to navigate a more laid-back culture fertile for missteps. "That's probably a lazy solution," said Bossola of The Need Supply "The worst-case scenario is that next Monday at Goldman Sachs, employees all wear chinos and plaid shirts. The best case is that they make an effort to craft a wardrobe that works for their industry." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In When   pursued the rights to a "Lord of the Rings" series in 2017, the company knew it would have to overcome some major obstacles to lure the J.R.R. Tolkien estate to its video-streaming platform. Amazon was a relative newcomer in video, with no track record of shepherding a blockbuster series. HBO, meanwhile, could tout its long history of hits, most notably "Game of Thrones," a similarly epic series based on fantasy novels with a rabid fan base.  , with more than 100 million subscribers, pioneered the on-demand model with hits such as "House of Cards" and "Orange is the New Black." And not to be ignored,   was also in on the negotiations to acquire the rights for the upcoming TV show, according to people familiar with the matter. Amazon didn't have much by way of Hollywood cred. What it had was the richest person on the planet in CEO  , a big "Lord of the Rings" fan, who was promising the Amazon Studios team a huge budget to nab the series, a prequel to Tolkien's "The Fellowship of the Ring." But money alone wasn't going to separate Amazon from the pack — Amazon's $250 million offer wasn't even the highest bid for the show's rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. The ultimate selling point, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations, related to Amazon's original business from over two decades ago: books. The Tolkien estate was convinced that in promoting the series, Amazon could sell truckloads of Tolkien's fantasy novels, including "The Hobbit" and "The Silmarillion" as well as "The Lord of the Rings." During meetings with the Tolkien estate and publisher HarperCollins, Amazon's Sharon Tal Yguado, who was hired from Fox in 2017, demonstrated a near encyclopedic knowledge of Tolkien's characters, stories and geography, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks were private. Amazon's ability to connect content to commerce won over the Tolkien estate. But just in case, to seal the deal, Amazon sent representatives of the Tolkien estate and its law firm, Greenberg Glusker, several crates of brand-new Amazon Echo speakers. Tolkien's people were flattered, though they also joked that Amazon delivered the home assistants to eavesdrop on the negotiations, two of the people said. The "Lord of the Rings" series will start production  . The huge investment in a TV series has made Hollywood wonder just how much Bezos will spend on content. So far, Amazon has dabbled across the TV spectrum, with original content such as "Lord of the Rings," a growing back catalog of movies and shows, as well as live sports from the National Football League and the Premier League. Just last month, Bezos was   with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell at the Super Bowl, a reminder that Amazon has several opportunities in the coming years to make a big splash in America's most lucrative sport. Meanwhile, The New York Post reported Thursday that  , the regional sports network in New York that carries Yankees games. Bezos has always taken the long view when getting into new business areas. Amazon Web Services launched in 2006 with simple hosted services targeted mostly at start-ups and companies with an experimental bent. By the time the rest of the industry realized Amazon was on to something and raced to launch their own cloud competitors, the company had built a huge lead. AWS now dominates the industry with  . It's the main driver of the company's profitability,   on sales of $25.7 billion last year — about 70 percent of the company's overall operating profit on only 10 percent of revenue. The company can afford to take a similar long view with its media business and try many different approaches. So far, Amazon has used video primarily as a way to build Prime subscriptions. But the company's investments point to blending content and commerce in ways the world hasn't yet seen, eventually pitting Amazon against Apple and other tech giants for control of the home. "Amazon hasn't gotten to the place yet where it has put together all of the levers that would make the video opportunity great," said Fred Seibert, the founder of independent production studio Frederator Networks, which is launching the animated show   on Prime Video on Friday. "But five years from now, they're going to be one of the giants in media. There's no doubt about it." When it comes to building businesses, Bezos doesn't follow traditional playbooks. Entertainment is no exception. Unlike HBO and Netflix, which buy content and spend on marketing and try to make all that money back through monthly subscriptions, Amazon has a more complex calculation that involves signing people up to Amazon Prime and making the annual membership package so compelling that they never leave. If same-day and two-day delivery, Whole Foods discounts and unlimited music aren't enough, perhaps your addiction to "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," "Catastrophe" or "Lord of the Rings," plus a steady stream of exclusive feature-length films, will keep you happy. Jennifer Salke, who took the helm of Amazon Studios  , told the   last month that her strategy in acquiring content is to enhance Prime and "invest in things that we think will be great for the service." Apple has a similar plan in mind with its yet-to-be-released streaming service, which will offer device owners   and subscriptions to third-party cable channels, according to people familiar with the matter. The idea is to give users enough value that it becomes a hassle to ditch the hardware. Amazon is so confident in Prime that last year it increased the yearly   to $119 from $99, the first hike since 2014. According to estimates from  , the number of Prime subscribers recently topped 100 million, and on average those customers spend about $1,400 per year, compared with about $600 per year for shoppers who aren't members. Amazon is playing many games at once with media: It not only offers its own Netflix-like service but also its own streaming hardware — Fire TV devices — and connections to other content channels. Once in the Amazon universe, cord-cutters can pay for streaming services separate from a traditional cable bundle. For example, Prime users can add Showtime or Starz for $8.99 a month. Amazon takes a cut of the revenue, typically about 25 percent for the largest companies, when a customer signs up. Amazon Channels — as the third-party service is known — has given traditional media companies a global platform to launch shows, said Jeff Hirsch, chief operating officer at Starz, which last year expanded into the  Hirsch said Channels has helped Starz, which is owned by Lionsgate, attract a broader audience of subscribers, because they can get the channel via the Amazon app rather than having to download the separate Starz app through  , Apple TV or another streaming device. Amazon also poses less of an existential threat in media than Apple, which blew up   by eradicating album sales with 99-cent digital tracks, or Netflix, the original Hollywood disruptor. "We view them as a partner," Hirsch said. "We have a wonderful relationship with Amazon, and it's gotten stronger. We've been very successful in terms of driving customers to their platform, and they've been great partners in helping us grow digitally." The Channels business replicates the traditional TV model of aggregating video channels, but without forcing customers to pay for a package of stuff they'll never watch. And there's all sorts of niche content that can now potentially find an audience. Think of it as an extension of Amazon's retail play: Create the world's largest online shopping mall and then invite smaller businesses to pay a toll in exchange for using the site to reach many millions of new customers. Seibert envisions  , which is about supernatural monsters, being promoted alongside searches for physical comic books and related merchandise. Amazon will be "one of the biggest friends to viable specialty channels in the next several years," Seibert said. "Offering media is a great service for customers looking for something special." If Amazon Channels is the neutral platform playing nice with content creators, Amazon Studios is a different beast altogether. It competes directly with the entertainment industry for original shows and movies. Amazon will spend $5 billion to $6 billion this year on content, according to an estimate from BTIG media analyst Rich Greenfield. That is a decent-sized bet for Hollywood but a tiny fraction of Amazon's operating expenses, which topped $220 billion last year. Netflix will likely spend about $15 billion on content this year, Greenfield estimated. There's no questioning Bezos' willingness to up the ante. He's got an increasingly healthy balance sheet — net income tripled to $10 billion in 2018. And investors have given him plenty of rope when it comes to spending. Still, Amazon hasn't rolled out a three- or five-year plan to reach Netflix-level spending. In fact, the company has no specific multiyear road map at all when it comes to content purchases, according to people familiar with the matter. Bezos and Jeff Blackburn, senior vice president of business development and digital entertainment, prefer not to plan more than 12 months in advance, the people said. That lack of planning and strategic focus may help explain why Amazon Studios has floundered at times in recent years. Prior to Salke taking over last year, Amazon Studios had been run by Roy Price, who departed Amazon   in late 2017. Like Salke, Price's stated strategy was to invest in shows that supported Prime. Amazon looked at who was watching a given show and saw how much that person was using Prime for other perks, mainly free shipping. If a Prime subscriber watched a show a lot and wasn't taking advantage of Prime's other benefits, the show got credit for that customer's subscription dollars, according to people familiar with Amazon's internal methods. Price was focused on high-minded, potentially award-winning content to lure users into Prime. His team had several hits, including " " and, more recently, " ," which won the 2018 Emmy Award for best comedy series. He also bought "Manchester By The Sea," winner of the 2017 Academy Award for best original screenplay, and "The Big Sick," which received an Academy Award nomination for its screenplay. Price's division also had some expensive misfires, such as Spike Lee's 2015 film "Chi-Raq" and a disastrous five-year movie deal with Woody Allen, who's now suing Amazon Studios in a $68 million  . In his three years running the business, Price purposefully avoided mass-appeal broadcast content, so that he could clearly differentiate Amazon from normal TV and justify the Prime membership. But buying niche, art house content wasn't a great approach to drawing tons of new people to Prime. David E. Kelley, the creator of shows such as "Ally McBeal," described Amazon's entertainment division in 2017 as "a bit of a gong show," in an interview with  . He added, "They are in way over their heads." Insert Salke, who was hired because of her prior experience at NBC and 20th Century Fox, where she bought and developed shows including "Modern Family," "Glee" and "The Good Place." Her mandate was to deliver broader hits with more of a broadcast sensibility, according to people familiar with the matter. Under Salke, Amazon has finally started to focus on "films and series with broader appeal that resonate with the wider consumer base that uses Amazon," said Floris Bauer, the co-founder and president of independent studio Gunpowder & Sky. "It's not to say you can't do award-winning films, but you're only hitting a certain group. It was a missed opportunity initially." Amazon didn't make Salke available for an interview for this story. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment for the story. Perhaps the biggest wild card in Amazon's role in the entertainment universe is live sports, a market that's still dominated by legacy networks and cable and satellite companies. Amazon is tinkering around the edges. Last year, the company inked a deal with Ultimate Fighting Championship to air pay-per-view fights. There's no discount available for Prime customers, but Prime is still very much in the equation. In the negotiations, Amazon asked the mixed martial arts league if it would consider scheduling more pay-per-view female fights, people with knowledge of the discussions said. Amazon told UFC its internal data indicated that an increase in female matches would appeal to Prime users, the people said, thus offering opportunities to promote Prime before, during and after matches. The pitch didn't work — UFC said top-level female fighting is still in its infancy and can't fill out a schedule — but the request underscored Amazon's broader effort. In August, Amazon hired   from ESPN to run sports programming, and the company will almost certainly become more aggressive at buying live sports rights in the coming years, according to people familiar with the company's long-term strategy. Separate from Amazon Studios, Donoghue's team also reports to Blackburn. The NFL is by far the most-watched league in the U.S., and chatter about its potential future with Amazon has picked up since Bezos' appearance at the Super Bowl.  DirecTV has locked up NFL Sunday Ticket, which allows millions of Americans to watch out-of-market games on satellite TV or their mobile devices, through 2022. Sunday Ticket was central to AT&T's $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV in 2015, and the joint company is now paying $1.5 billion a year for the rights. But the NFL has an opt-out clause after the 2019 season that would allow it to end the DirecTV deal or potentially sell streaming rights separately. That's not Amazon's only opportunity for getting into the action. ESPN's contract for Monday night games ends after the 2021 season, and Fox and CBS own rights to Sunday games through 2022. Thursday night games, currently on Fox, and Sunday night games on NBC come up for renewal at the same time. Amazon has   Thursday night games globally for the past two seasons and will next year as well, but those rights are digital only, so they don't require fans to choose Amazon over traditional TV. The company has also been pursuing baseball, holding talks with the New York Yankees for   over the YES Network, CNBC  . And Amazon struck a deal last year to exclusively stream 20 Premier League soccer matches. It all adds up to a hodgepodge of assets that Amazon could potentially own as it expands its empire. "This is not just about showcasing football games on Thursday night," Greenfield said. "This is selling you a jersey. This is potentially selling you a ticket. There's so much more that Amazon can do than just simply stream a game. They can probably sell advertising better than any TV network because of the data they have and they know exactly what I like." Amazon has one other weapon that gives it a distinct advantage over Netflix and its other media peers: the Echo. As more of the Alexa-powered devices populate consumers' homes, it's not hard to imagine tighter integrations with smart TVs. That opens Amazon up to all sorts of untapped opportunities with advertising and cross-selling products. "Amazon knows how to run a store," said Seibert of Frederator Networks. "They're walking toward how to make media work. If they can marry the two, everyone else in the media business will start to scramble." It was the Echo, after all, that Amazon used to sweeten its offer to the Tolkien estate for "Lord of the Rings." "There is an all-out war for the control of your media life," Greenfield said. "I think the reality is these big tech platforms, who have valuations and market caps and cash piles that are massive relative to traditional media, they are just getting started."

     Keep Me Logged In The unemployment rate   in February, according to the Labor Department. But a broader measurement says the jobless rate plunged to 7.3 percent last month. The 3.8 percent figure is known as the U-3 rate, which is defined as "total unemployed, as a percent of the civilian labor force." But this number doesn't include the underemployed or the discouraged. The U-6 rate is a more encompassing unemployment rate that counts discouraged workers who aren't currently looking for jobs as well as those holding jobs part time for economic reasons. The U-6 rate, often called the "real" unemployment rate, dropped to 7.3 percent in February from 8.1 percent in January. That is the lowest reading of the five most recent reports. The number of those employed part time for economic reasons tumbled by 837,000, to 4.3 million, while those completing temporary jobs fell by 225,000. A Labor Department office said it was a consequence of the government shutdown that ended in late February.  in February after a blistering start to the year, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by just 20,000, falling short of the relatively modest expectations of 180,000 from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. It was the worst month for job creation since September 2017, offset somewhat by a solid increase in wages. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Nobel laureate   suggests a self-fulfilling is prophecy unfolding on Wall Street that could ultimately derail the longest bull market in history. According to the Yale University economics professor, growing worries about a recession could make it come sooner — even if there isn't a specific event to spark it. "A lot of people have that on their mind, and they think it's got to turn soon. I'm kind of with that. You know, if people think that, they're going to make it happen," Shiller said Wednesday on CNBC's " ." Shiller, who's known for his  , estimates there's about a 50 percent chance the economy will tip into a recession within 18 months. He's not sure what how long it could last or the magnitude. However, he isn't ruling out a Trump-related event — even though the president has been an integral part of the economic narrative  . "People who are good storytellers — like Donald J. Trump is a brilliant storyteller — they tend to rise in our economy," Shiller said. "He models a general public support for business, cuts profits taxes — what more can you ask?" But if Trump loses his base because of his legal woes, Shiller believes that  . He also refers to the growing budget deficit as an ominous economic issue. It grew to $913 billion for the fiscal year ending in January. That's 77 percent higher than the previous year. And it's expected to get worse. The Congressional Budget Office projects yearly budget shortfalls will surpass $1 trillion beginning in 2022. "That attention to public debt has waxed and waned throughout history," Shiller said. "It seems like the public is OK with it for now. But I think in the back of their minds they're not so sure."

One technical analyst says this needs to happen in the stock before it looks like a buy again. The S&P 500 has raced higher this quarter, and one group of stocks has done the heavy lifting. However, one market watcher warns that some investors may be missing out. Snap soared Thursday, and is now up more than 100 percent since the start of the year. But Blue Line Futures' Bill Baruch says don't be tempted to buy due to "fear of missing out." ECRI's Lakshman Achuthan builds his bearish case on a chart of falling semiconductor shipment demand.

     Keep Me Logged In Women-owned businesses continue to be a growth engine for the U.S. economy, and recent data shows their access to capital is an indicator of the phenomenon. The number of women-owned businesses that applied for funding in 2018 increased by 13 percen , according to an annual study of women-owned companies by Biz2Credit, a leading online credit marketplace for small companies. But it revealed that loans for women entrepreneurs where nearly one third less than for their male counterparts. The study, which included 30,000 companies nationwide in more than 20 industries — including retail, health care, hospitality, construction and professional services, among others — revealed that the average loan amount for women-owned companies was $48,341 last year. The most common type of funding was working capital for business expansion. Nearly 1 in 5 loan applications from women-owned businesses were in services (19.7%), retail (18.2%), accommodation and food services (14.3%), health care and social assistance (7.6%) and construction (6.4%). According to Biz2Credit figures, the top five states for applications from women-owned businesses were California (13%), Texas (11%), New York (6%), Georgia (6%), and Ohio (5%). These are in technology centers and in places where the real estate markets are also booming. This trend is being driven by a confluence of factors, including a strong economy and an increasing desire among women of all ages to start and run their own companies. There are now 12.3 million women-owned businesses in the United States, according to a report by American Express and SCORE. Compare that to 1972, when there were only 402,000 women-owned businesses, representing just 4.6 percent of all firms. Women are willing to take on more risk, since the economy remains strong. Optimism among small business owners was the  , according to the NFIB. The organization's monthly Small Business Optimism Index also reported that owners believe the current period is a good time to expand substantially, and they are planning to invest in more inventory and are reporting high sales figures. Statistics tell the story. Last year 1,821 new women-owned businesses were launched every day, the Amex-SCORE report revealed. Women of color founded 64 percent of those businesses. But women still have a long way to go in order to have gender equality in the lending market. The   found that the average size loan for women-owned businesses was 31 percent less than for male-owned businesses ($70,239) in 2018. Part of this can be attributed to the fact that women are better bootstrappers and save up more money before borrowing, since women typically are more risk averse than men. The study shows that female-owned firms are younger businesses with a shorter track history of repayment of debts. It is harder for such companies to secure capital through traditional bank loans. Nonetheless, female-owned firms are booming. Women are opening an average of 849 new businesses per day, according to American Express's   (2017). The study found that the number of women-owned businesses has increased 114 percent in the past two decades, and the number of companies owned by women of color has increased 467 percent. Minority women now own 46 percent of all women-owned firms, according to the report. Lending activity from the SBA helps women-owned companies secure capital for growth. The agency facilitates federally guaranteed loans to small businesses that might not otherwise qualify for traditional bank term loans. SBA loans totaled $25.37 billion in the fiscal year that ended in October 2018. Many of the loans go to women-owned and minority-owned businesses. "More women are realizing that they have more opportunities and are transitioning out of some areas of the workforce, SBA administrator Linda McMahon recently told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo. "New business creation is prevalent in the tech field. They might know how to build an app or know the latest in machine learning, but don't know how to run a business and might want to. That's where the SBA can help." McMahon also said that women are moving into the fast-growing health-care services sector. Average annual revenues of women-owned business rose from $202,491 in 2017 to $228,578 in 2018, according to Biz2Credit, which analyzed 30,000 applications from business owners through its online platform last year. Meanwhile, businesses owned by men in 2018 generated about 7 percent more revenue ($473,157) than they did in 2017 ($444,227), and made $244,579 more revenue on average than women-owned businesses last year. Even though women-owned businesses are growing, they still face challenges, especially when the company is in a male-dominated industry. For instance, Maryam Zadeh, owner of the trendy   in Brooklyn, New York, had a high credit score of 700 and a growing customer base, yet still found it challenging to secure funding. Eventually Zadeh secured a bridge loan to secure a larger space for her gym in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn, a once gritty area that is now booming. She also was able to secure a $100,000 line of credit from Biz2Credit to continue her growth plans. "We're a pioneer in Brooklyn with a boutique fitness gym with high-intensity training. I can get press and have a level of notoriety, but often lenders will still ask me where my 'male partner' is," said Zadeh. Interestingly, credit scores for women business owners and the average age of women-owned companies applying for   dipped. Biz2Credit found that the average credit scores for women-owned businesses dropped from 598 in 2017 to 588 in 2018 and trailed the scores of their male counterparts (613) by 25 points. One reason is that companies are being started at a record pace, and many of these entrepreneurs — particularly minority women — are younger and don't have a long track record of repaying debt. Thus, their credit scores will be lower than their male counterparts. According to a  , women shoulder around $890 billion in student loans — the vast majority of the outstanding student loan balance in the U.S. — and once they have those degrees, they earn less than men do. Thus, it takes women longer to repay debts. Many times their companies are underfunded, and lower credit scores are certainly a factor. "There are some very practical actions that women can take to improve credit scores, such as ensuring they are making payments on time, keeping credit utilization to 30 percent or less and limiting the number of credit inquires, to name a few," Adrienne Garland of  , an expert on women's entrepreneurship said. "With improved credit scores, women can seek larger amounts of financing and use that as leverage to propel their businesses to even greater levels of growth and profitability to accomplish their goals and pursue their dreams."

     Keep Me Logged In There is one simple solution for companies to make more money, Bank of America Merrill Lynch research shows: Hire more women. Haim Israel, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a note to clients Wednesday that gender diversity can boost return on equity, profit, dividends and market cap at a lower risk rate. And companies that focus on diversity trade at a premium to others. Israel's note comes amid increasing attention around the pay and employment gap between men and women. Several companies, including General Motors and Johnson & Johnson,  . Democratic lawmakers also unveiled the   earlier this year, which aims to close the gender pay gap. Israel says there is still a lot to do on this front, however. "The economic gender gap is reducing at a snail's pace and, all being equal, will not close for centuries - 202 years," he said. "Corporate America does not look like Main St. America: the average S&P 500 board seats four men for every woman; just 5% of companies have a woman at the helm, and the S&P 600 small cap index, which reflects more recently established corporations, looks even worse on these statistics." But the situation is not as dire in Europe. Israel said the percentage of women on corporate boards in Europe is up 200 percent in the past 15 years. Companies that have seen greater diversity on their boards have also seen lower volatility in earnings and dividends, he said. "Incentives to close the gender gap are evident." Equality for women could also lead to a massive boost to the economy. Research from McKinsey found gender equality could lead to a global economic boost of between $12 trillion and $28 trillion by 2025. Women's role in corporations and the world economy is also growing. S&P Global research, citing the Boston Consulting Group, said women are expected to hold $72 trillion of the world's financial assets by 2020. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard called Thursday for caution toward monetary policy as downside risks grow for the U.S. economy. The central bank official said she's downgraded her outlook as dangers have grown both domestically and from abroad. "I see the appropriate posture as watchful waiting," Brainard said during a speech in Princeton, New Jersey. "I don't want to prejudge what kind of moves may be appropriate later in the year, but for now I think it's very important to gather more information on those cross-currents while we engage in watchful waiting." Citing softness in spending and investment, Brainard said ongoing trade tensions, Brexit and economic weakness in China also pose challenges. "While strong foreign growth provided tailwinds early last year, foreign growth projections have been revised down repeatedly more recently," she said. "The slowdown of foreign growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed, with growth likely running below potential for most of last year." After hiking interest rates four times in 2018,   toward future moves. Current projections indicate two more increases this year, though that could change when individual Federal Open Market Committee members update their projections later this month. Markets also have been watching the Fed's intentions with the bonds it is holding on its $4 trillion balance sheet. The central bank has been steadily reducing the size of its portfolio, but recent indications are that the roll-off is near an end. Brainard echoed comments from other officials that she expects the balance sheet reduction to come to a close by the end of 2019. The size of the balance sheet is tied to bank reserves, which likely will run considerably higher than had been the norm before the financial crisis. "We have gathered information from market contacts and have surveyed banks to assess their demand for reserves," Brainard said. "I would want to see a healthy cushion on top of that to avoid unnecessary volatility and ensure that the federal funds rate will be largely insulated from daily swings in factors affecting reserves." The balance sheet reached a peak of $4.5 trillion, the result of three rounds of bond buying during and after the financial crisis. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Keep Me Logged In The change from atoms to bits is irrevocable and unstoppable.” It’s been over 20 years since Nicholas Negroponte made that claim in his groundbreaking book, Being Digital. He was describing the process of digitalization, making the point that atoms are the essential building blocks of the physical world, while bits are those of the virtual. Back then, the first wave of digitalization was often applied to media. Vinyl records gave way to Compact Discs which ultimately became mp3s — music became nothing more than digital information. Today, the process of digitalization is well underway. Our music, photos, documents — practically everything — are completely digital. The next phase has become known as digital transformation (DX), whereby companies completely adopt digital technologies, like the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), artificial intelligence (AI) or digital twins throughout their operation. The promise of DX is to create new value, which can take the shape of new work processes, products and services, or even new business models. Incorporating DX can help a company gain an edge over competitors, as it increases efficiency and profitability across the enterprise. In reality, when DX is attempted by companies with existing complex systems and which are run by actual human beings, it becomes clear that DX is as much of a leadership and mental challenge as a technological one. It requires a change in culture and mindset and can’t be done without the right people and partners. o see some of benefits of DX, we can look at the process industry, which includes everything from food and beverage to chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Within the process industry, digital technologies can be applied to automate more and more operations, optimize supply chains, realize smart manufacturing (using data and analytics throughout a manufacturing process) and improve the decision making process. These improvements open up new possibilities and often lead to entirely new business models and offerings. Access to new information and the automation of previously manual tasks bring about a change of mindset within the organization. All of these aspects have a real economic benefit thanks to things such as cost savings from predictive maintenance, higher human productivity and the lower cost of operations due to optimization. McKinsey & Co predicts that by 2025 the economic impact of DX will be as high as US$3.7 trillion for all manufacturing industries. Business leaders already recognize the need for change. A recent study of 116 corporate executives across 18 countries by SAP, showed that 90% think DX is important for their company’s overall business strategies. And according to IDG, 37% of organizations “have already started integrating and executing a digital-first approach.” Once the decision has been made, what next? Again, we can look to the process industry. As an example KLS Sharma, who literally wrote the book on industrial process automation, described the benefits of DX this way: [It] helps companies exploit the potentials hidden in their supply chain by streamlining processes, increase data transparency, and allowing for better and quicker decision making. New ideas and concepts are developing around IT-OT, providing major opportunities to leverage IT know-how to the production floor. This can make a difference when competing with peers. Yokogawa, a leader in advanced industrial instruments, automated control technology, and digital control and data analysis solutions, has garnered extensive expertise in the Industrial Automation business and supports their customers on a long-term basis not only to digitize data on the shop floor, but also to understand and utilize this data for enhanced performance in business operations. Yokogawa’s specialty in gathering data goes all the way back to the company’s founding in 1915, when they began making electric meters. That tradition has continued to include all sorts of accurate sensor and calibration equipment — from optical wavelength meters to process gas chromatographs. But gathering data is not enough; it needs to be analyzed to provide insights, and that’s a shortcoming of most companies today. Many have not yet reached the stage where they can make sense of the large amount of data they have collected. This is where partnerships with Yokogawa, can bring a multitude of benefits. They know where the data is coming from and how to utilize it to the best advantage. By working closely with their clients, Yokogawa discovers their needs. For example, when fluctuations in demand and prices were seen in the oil and gas sector, companies were pressured to limit capital expenditures. Improving plant operational efficiency by maximizing existing assets therefore became more and more important. Yokogawa helped their oil & gas clients adapt by employing new digital technology to save money on equipment through predictive and prescriptive maintenance approaches. In this case, IIoT was one of the ways to achieve DX. The existence of the IIoT solution led to new work process and business models. For example, remote pump diagnostics, which saves money by reducing the amount of time spent traveling and servicing industrial pumps, and “compressed-air-as-a-service,” which would not be possible without DX keeping the cost of maintaining air compressors low. In general, the proliferation and reduced cost of IT and digital technologies has moved from the enterprise level to the shop-floor. On the path “from atoms to bits,” everything within the process industry — people, services, supply chains, data — is becoming connected and integrated. The myriad connections are similar to those of neurons in the human brain, leading Yokogawa to dub the process “Synaptic Business Automation.” “Synaptic Business Automation is Yokogawa’s unique Industrial Automation (IA) business concept. Because it encompasses the entire business, and not just one part, it is able to help the company evolve and adapt. It allows all the different aspects of the company to work together in the most efficient and optimized way, so it can continue to add value and become competitive in a sustainable way.” If a company can truly digitalize, it can make the operation more resilient because it improves the ability to manage risk. Breakdowns can be predicted and prevented. Health and safety can be improved, and complex compliance regimes can be better managed. In a production plant, the digitalization of plant data, combined with deep knowledge of how they affect plant performance, allows for the optimization of production. But perhaps the greatest benefit of DX is the generation of business innovation. Business innovation refers to creating new sources of value and completely new business models. New business models are so important because DX is not just a strategy for a single company — it is a world-wide trend. A company’s competitors, suppliers, vendors — event their customers — are all going through their own DX. The future is inherently unpredictable. If you aren’t looking for ways to collaborate and co-create new business models that synch with the rest of the world, you are taking a risk. n one study by SAP, when business leaders were asked if their employees had the necessary skills to carry out DX, only 15% said yes. This lack of in-house expertise is a large barrier to many companies. In fact, it is very difficult for any single company to undertake DX by themselves. That’s why it is so important to work with the right partner. According to The Everest Group, 81% of top companies used third-party services to gain access to innovation. And it seems executives are ready for it. Bain & Company found that, 59% of executives were open to the idea of spurring innovation by “collaborating with outsiders, even competitors.” The support and flexibility at the executive level is key. DX also requires a reform of corporate culture. McKinsey found that, in companies with successful transformations, senior managers were more involved, they did their best to ensure collaboration across their organizations, and they encouraged their employees to experiment. This spirit of collaboration is exactly what Yokogawa brings to their DX partners. Co-innovation is their calling card. Their expertise goes back decades in automated and digital control technology such as IT-OT, data analysis solutions, and domain / business knowledge of Industrial Automation business. Identifying which stage of DX their client is at, Yokogawa integrates these applications and technologies in line with their client’s aims, and becomes a trusted partner in journey to achieve digital transformation.

     Keep Me Logged In Once again, we are seeing the usual hand-wringing over the fact that after a 17 percent rally from the December low, some of the stock market's sector leaders are meeting resistance.  Leadership groups like semiconductors, the Russell 2000, banks and industrials have been weaker in the last couple weeks and with good reason. The markets are no longer cheap. Since Feb. 24, the   is down 1.5 percent. In the same period, semiconductors are down 2.7 percent, the Russell 2000 has slipped 3.9 percent, banks are down 4 percent and industrial stocks have shed 2.6 percent. The key to getting markets moving again is to stop the decline in earnings estimates. There are signs that is happening.  On Jan. 1, first quarter earnings were expected to be up 5.3 percent, but that forecast collapsed over the next six weeks. In early February, the revised forecast was looking for earnings to be up 0.7 percent, and later that slipped to an estimate calling for earnings to be down 0.5  percent. As of today, the estimate is calling for earnings to be down 1.3 percent. So, the rate of decline is slowing and it is likely earnings will end up positive for the first quarter.  That's because corporations typically provide conservative guidance and beat estimates by a roughly 3-percentage-point margin. If the estimates are calling for earnings to be down 1.3 percent right now, and if they stay in this range, it's likely earnings will be up somewhere in the 1 percent range. "While EPS estimates have gone lower, they have not fallen nearly as much as feared," Nick Raich, who follows corporate earnings at Earnings Scout, told clients on Thursday. There is a good chance the much-feared "earnings recession" will not begin in the first quarter. That is a term that describes two consecutive quarters when earnings decline over the prior year quarter. Also, do not underestimate the power of central banks. We had the Fed pivot in December to less aggressive stance. And on Thursday we had the European Central Bank make the same move with President Mario Draghi leaving rates unchanged, dramatically downgrading Eurozone growth prospects and launching another lending program offering cheap money to banks. Finally, maybe it's time we all got more reasonable with future expectations in the stock market. With the S&P up nearly 10 percent this year, investors have become used to the idea of an endless up spiral in the next decade. Maybe it's time to temper that. The current bull market turns 10 years old at Friday's close. At Wednesday's close the S&P's 10-year annualized return was a whopping 17.5 percent, the best since early-2001, according to Advisor Investments. That is way above the historic returns of about 7 percent a year. This is why everyone from Vanguard on down have been saying to temper forward expectations. In a recent interview with CNBC, Vanguard CIO Greg Davis told me the firm's expectations for U.S. equity market returns are lower for the next 10 years. "If we look forward for the next 10 years, our expectations around U.S. equity markets is for about a 5 percent median annualized return," he told CNBC on Feb. 11. "Five years ago, we'd have been somewhere in around 8 percent." The S&P 500 is now at the highest level since early October after breaking through key resistance levels. Investing in low-cost, passive funds remains the soundest long-term investment. Boeing threatened to disrupt the market's climb, but there are a number of factors at play that are boosting stocks. Maybe it's time we all got more reasonable with future expectations in the stock market. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. and China will need to overcome significant hurdles in resolving long-term disagreements if they are to build on the momentum from the past week of trade talks. The United States is planning to delay a menu of additional Chinese tariffs that were scheduled to begin on March 1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on its best winning streak since 1995, but the 'godfather' of chart analysis, says a pullback is necessary before rallying further. Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In Since the market bottomed during the financial crisis, the   has gained more than 312 percent, but some individual stocks have gained thousands of times over.

     Keep Me Logged In Billion-dollar corporate mergers may be about to get a   bump of sorts. Now that the stock market has mostly recovered from last year's swoon and the government reopened after the longest shutdown in U.S. history, CEOs are once again mulling deals to scale up their businesses or sell themselves to a willing partner. But there's one date on the calendar that CEOs are eyeing warily: Nov. 3, 2020, according to John Richert,  's head of   investment banking. The expectation is that as the election campaign season heats up, uncertainty will spike as a fiery, unpredictable President Donald Trump faces off with Democratic candidates proposing changes to taxes and regulation. "Most of the CEOs I'm talking to would like to get something done this year and not have to deal with the noise of next year," Richert said. "People are going to really drive hard to get things done this year in a known environment." Deals in North America hit $2.22 trillion last year, the second biggest total after 2015, fueled by a surge in megadeals of at least $10 billion, according to J.P. Morgan data. But the pace slowed late in 2018 after stock and debt markets seized up and the U.S. government shuttered in December. Merger prospects turned around recently after markets rebounded in January and February and the Federal Reserve signaled that slowing growth around the world made it pause its campaign of raising interest rates. That soothed concerns that a recession could strike in 2019, giving business leaders a window to attempt deals this year, Richert said. The deals pipeline has sputtered back to life, and there will be a wave of announcements in the next two to three months, he said. "Now that the Fed has gone the other direction, and you've had a complete recorrection in markets, people feel good about this year," he said. "What it's really going to come down to is how much of a distraction will the 2020 election be from a confidence standpoint." Of particular focus for Richert and his team of regional investment bankers are deals in the $1 billion to $3 billion range. He believes that is a sweet spot as megadeals become scarcer as investors shy away from financing the massive transactions. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In For investors struggling to find opportunities after a stellar rebound in the aging bull market, value stocks might be the best bet. Case in point: Cheaply priced stocks are getting cheaper as expensive stocks have gotten extremely pricey, pushing the valuation gap to the widest in 70 years, according to AB Bernstein. The record dispersion puts cheap equities in a sweet spot as other pockets of the market start losing the appeal because of their high prices. "Value tends to outperform when dispersion in valuations across the market is at its widest," said Bernstein's Inigo Fraser-Jenkins in a note on Wednesday. "Valuation spreads are incredibly wide and sentiment may have found a floor. This provides a support for value within the market contrasted with traditional asset classes which are mostly fully valued." The stock market has staged a strong comeback, with the   notching   to a year since 1991, but value stocks seemed to have missed the rally. According to Bernstein, the composite value stocks lost 1.04 percent year-to-date, versus the S&P 500's more than 11 percent gain. Many have argued that the market rebound is  , as earnings and growth expectations have come down. "Value as a style tends to perform better than average when there have been extreme troughs in the earnings revisions balance series particularly 6 to 12 months following the point of most aggressive downgrades," Fraser-Jenkins said. Wall Street analysts have been aggressive when it comes to slashing their earnings expectations. The estimates for the S&P 500's first quarter earnings have dropped 6.5 percent in the first two months of 2019 alone, the largest cut since the first quarter in 2016, according to FactSet. Analysts are projecting an earnings loss of 3.2 percent in the first quarter and a gain of 4.1 percent for 2019. Bernstein said investors could buy cheap individual stocks in different sectors, or they could buy stocks that are "cheap per unit fundamentals," their so-called "residual value factor." The stocks that screen well on residual value and are also rated outperform by Bernstein analysts include  ,  ,   and  . Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Firms should stop share buybacks and end a fixation on short-term earnings, the chief executive of one of the world's largest financial services companies told CNBC. In the United States, announced buybacks for 2018   as firms looked to use surplus cash flow to increase the earnings per share (EPS) metric. The trend suggested that boardrooms feel that their own share price was undervalued and that there was little else better to invest in. A large amount of that cash to buy the shares was made available after President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which allowed U.S. companies to freely bring home cash that had been held overseas. Some have heavily criticized the scale of buybacks, suggesting that while it has created a boon for shareholders it does little for workers or innovation within firms. British multinational   has more than £1 trillion ($1.3 trillion) worth of assets under management. Around 80 percent of its investments are in tradable credit markets with about 20 percent reserved for direct bets on companies and industries. Company CEO Nigel Wilson told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Wednesday that boardroom executives should manage their businesses for the longer term, "rather than maximizing their leverage rate and buying back shares." "There are wonderful investment opportunities out their right now and people should be trying to capture the growth," he added. Wilson also criticised the quarter-to-quarter pressure of managing a public company. "We would like it if we dropped quarterly earnings reports here and in the United States, because it would just make everybody think much more about the longer term." On Wednesday the group's operating profit rose 14 percent to £2.3 billion and assets under management topped £1 trillion. The firm cited record sales of retirement annuities. Shares in the firm fell sharply however after it missed a key analyst metric which calculates an insurer's capital strength against potential losses. Legal & General has said it has a surplus of £6.9 billion in capital to deploy should here be a major shake out in credit markets. Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

     Keep Me Logged In Bank regulators are renewing efforts to require Wall Street executives to defer more compensation and claw back bonuses if losses happen, according to  . U.S. regulators are hoping to finish rules called for in the sweeping post-financial crisis banking regulation known as the  , the Journal said. The thrust of the rules would be to more closely match pay with the long-term health of financial institutions. Talks are in an early stage and involve the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the newspaper said, citing sources with knowledge of the plans. Banks and other financial firms faced a backlash over pay after the crisis because some traders and executives reaped millions of dollars for taking risks that later blew up, requiring taxpayer-funded bailouts. But the industry has stymied regulators' earlier efforts to set restrictions on compensation, helped in part because of disagreement between the half-dozen regulators who have some role in bank supervision, the newspaper said. While banks including   have voluntarily implemented rules on vesting and sales of stock compensation, new rules could mandate stiffer restrictions and expand the number of bank employees subject to them, the newspaper said. Securities firms paid out $31.4 billion in bonuses in New York in 2017, the most in a decade, according to the Journal. Read the full Journal report  . Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In The Federal Reserve says the U.S. economy was expanding in January and February, but half the country was seeing fallout from the 35-day partial government shutdown. Some manufacturers expressed worries about weakening global demand for their products and adverse effects from President Donald Trump's trade policies. In its latest report on economic conditions around the country, the Fed said that 10 of its 12 regions reported "slight-to-moderate growth" over the past two months. Two — Philadelphia and St. Louis — reported that conditions were "flat." The Fed report, known as the beige book, will be used when central bank officials meet March 19-20 to consider what to do with interest rates. The expectation is that the central bank will remain "patient" and leave rates unchanged. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In For many women in venture capital, there's no question the industry has a gender disparity problem. Venture capital, or VC, partnerships "have historically been built by men," investor Ophelia Brown tells CNBC. VC companies consist of general partners, who manage funds and advise on investment decisions, and limited partners, who give them the capital to work with. That trend of male-dominated funds hasn't budged much. Female partners are still a minority —   — and most of the VC dollars are going into male-founded start-ups. In Europe, for example,   by tech investment firm Atomico shows that 93 percent of venture money went to start-ups with all-male founding teams last year. "The challenge is, building a partnership is an incredibly delicate thing," Brown, formerly of Index Ventures, says. For context, Index Ventures has made a number of notable Silicon Valley exits — from   to, more recently,  . Brown now manages a fund called Blossom Capital, which is focused on Europe's start-up scene. Blossom, founded in 2016, recently closed an $85 million fund dedicated to pouring cash into proven early-stage start-ups. When it comes to gender equality, one main hurdle for the industry to overcome, Brown says, is finding the limited partners necessary to back female-founded venture teams. A solution? Limited partners need to take more risks and pluck up the courage to back new female-focused funds, according to Brown. Limited partners are usually high net-worth-individuals and institutions — many of which are overwhelmingly male — so there needs to be more women who are putting money on the table, she says. "I would say there are a lot of female-focused initiatives that actually come short because they say they're reserving pockets for women but don't," she says. "And it's kind of like, well how do you get women into partnerships if you're still going to be quite risk averse in your capital provision?" Brown's logic being that, without enough investment players willing to contribute to female-led venture funds, women may be discouraged from entering the industry altogether. In her own experience, Brown says she's noticed "a lot of bias" in favor of male-led teams on the institutional side of the VC market. Institutional investors include pension funds, endowments and funds of funds. Suzanne Ashman, a partner at seed investment firm LocalGlobe, says she's not seen "any bias" against women from limited partners, but agrees "they are pretty much exclusively male." "There are few female LPs in venture funds," she says. "That in and of itself is a challenge." Although, Ashman adds LocalGlobe has been "fortunate enough to work with a couple." For Brown's part, she says she's been "very fortunate" to raise money from LPs that back Blossom Capital "because they want to maximize their returns." But there's more to be done to promote women in the industry and raise them through the ranks, she adds. LocalGlobe's Ashman agrees. "Some progress" has been made, but "certainly not enough." There are a number of other challenges to solve before getting anywhere close to gender diversity in the industry, she says. "You've got too few female founders, too few women within tech companies that have meaningful equity, too few female angel investors... and there aren't enough women in decision-making roles," Ashman says. "I think the next step for how we see more women in decision-making roles in venture funds is: make sure your entry level hires are diverse, and be more open to the kinds of backgrounds and profiles you're going to look for."

     Keep Me Logged In U.S. government debt yields held lower Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would delay its plan to hike interest rates and launch a program to stimulate banking lending in the euro zone. Yields initially ticked upward following the central bank's decision to keep borrowing costs low, but quickly reversed course and turned lower within minutes. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, was last seen at 2.679 percent. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at 3.061 percent. The ECB said its new targeted refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) stimulus program will start in  . The loans offer European banks lower rates, making it easier for them to lend money to consumers with the idea of buoying the economy. This is the third stimulus injection from the ECB since 2014. The bank   Thursday and updated its guidance. Interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0, 0.25 and -0.40 percent respectively. Investors are eager to know details from trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. Data out on Wednesday showed that the U.S. trade deficit remains a problem. President   has imposed a series of tariffs on countries like China, in an attempt to bring down his country's trade deficit. However, Wednesday's data showed that trade deficit in the U.S. hit a 10-year high in December. As trade talks between the world's largest economies continue, there's fresh tensions regarding Chinese tech giant Huawei. The firm filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government, claiming a law that bans it from selling equipment to government agencies is unconstitutional. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Job growth came to a near halt in February after a blistering start to the year, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by just 20,000 even as the unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent, the Labor Department reported Friday. It was the worst month for job creation since September 2017, when two major hurricanes hit the employment market, offset somewhat by a solid increase in wages. The month fell short of the relatively modest expectations of 180,000 from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate had been projected at 3.9 percent from January's 4 percent. "I think it's a very fluky number," Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council under President Donald Trump, told CNBC in a "Squawk on the Street" interview. The jobless rate fell in part because of the vagaries the Labor Department uses to calculate the headline rate — there was an increase of 198,000 in those considered not in the labor force, while those classified as unemployed fell by 300,000 and the ranks of the employed decreased by 45,000, according to the household survey. A more encompassing unemployment rate that counts discouraged workers as well as those holding jobs part time for economic reasons, often called the "real" unemployment rate, plunged to 7.3 percent in February from 8.1 percent in January. Those employed part time for economic reasons tumbled by 837,000 to 4.3 million while those completing temporary jobs fell by 225,000, which a Labor Department official said was a consequence of the government shutdown that ended in late January. "A shockingly low jobs figure for February does not change the labor market narrative by itself," said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide. "The three-month trend in job gains remains solid while survey data suggest no letup in demand for workers by employers." Among major worker groups, the jobless rate for Hispanics also declined sharply to 4.3 percent from 4.9 percent in January. The rate for African-Americans rose two-tenths of a point to 7 percent, while the level for whites declined to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent. There was other good news in the report: Average hourly earnings increased by 3.4 percent year over year, easily the best of the economic recovery that began nearly 10 years ago. That compares with a 1.5 percent increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers from January 2018 to January 2019. Economists had been expecting a wage increase of 3.2 percent. "Certainly the headline is somewhat shocking given how big January's number was," said Marvin Loh, global macro strategist at State Street. "It certainly shows a weakening trend given where we were six or nine months ago. But it also shows that wage growth, and expectations that this low unemployment rate is going to drive higher wages, is still there." Federal Reserve policymakers have been watching inflation-related data closely, with particular attention to wages. Central bank officials have indicated they are going to watch the data for a period before deciding on future interest rate moves. "If anything, the wage number could raise some eyebrows for the Fed. I don't think the slowdown in the pace of payrolls does anything to change the outlook," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. "They're pretty comfortable sitting back and waiting for the data to come through." Professional and business services saw the highest level of job creation, with 42,000 new positions. Health care added 21,000 and wholesale trade rose 11,000. On the downside, construction lost 31,000 and leisure and hospitality, a key component of the recovery, was flat for the month. Government jobs fell by 5,000. Previous months' gains were revised up, with December moving from 222,000 to 227,000 while January's hot start looked even better, going from an initially reported 304,000 to 311,000. Payroll gains averaged 186,000 during the three-month period. The job numbers came amid questions about growth in 2019 following a year where GDP accelerated at close to a 3 percent pace. Economists generally expect very little growth in the first quarter as the U.S. recovers from a lackluster holiday shopping season and concerns persist about a global slowdown that is finding its way into the domestic economy. Federal Reserve officials of late have said they also see growth decelerating, citing weakness in China's economy that comes on top of the U.S.-China trade war. Other worries include a messy Brexit and a weakening U.S. housing market and business investment picture. A report Friday indicated that housing starts in January posted an 18.6 percent increase from December, providing some hope that the market is recovering from a lackluster 2018. Building permits rose 1.4 percent from the previous month. Getting a true picture of the economy in the first quarter has been difficult, however, due to issues emanating from the government shutdown that ended in late January. Many government reports have been delayed, so economists and Wall Street have been using the nonfarm payrolls count, which was not disrupted by the shutdown, as a barometer for growth.

     Keep Me Logged In  slowed to a crawl with just 20,000 payrolls added, but it is more the result of temporarily sluggish growth and not a sign of recession. The shockingly weak report was about 160,000 fewer jobs than economists had forecast, but it follows January's surprisingly strong 311,000 payrolls, which were revised higher by 7,000 workers. The unemployment rate also fell by 0.2 percentage point to 3.8 percent and average hourly wages grew at an annual pace of 3.4 percent. "I don't think there's a recession on the horizon. However, the market has to grapple with a slowing economy against the backdrop of a much weaker global environment and therefore questions about the U.S. ability to remain decoupled from the rest of the world will persist," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. Economists were quick to point to the fact that the government data has been inconsistent since the government shutdown and may have been affected by both the 35-day shutdown and a temporary work furlough for government employees and private sector contractors. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow   in an interview on CNBC's " ." "Right now, we're still waiting to get enough consistent data so we can assess what's going on. At this point, these numbers don't do that," said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. "In some respect, it's not dissimilar to the December retail sales numbers that were so weak they weren't believable." The delayed January retail sales report is scheduled to be released Monday, and economists are watching to see if there is a revision to December's 1.2 percent decline. "We had the teacher's strike, and government employment had a hard time ramping back up so that pulled a lot of things down. There's a lot of noise in the payroll data," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. Stock futures dipped after the jobs report, but were already lower after very weak Chinese export data renewed fears of a global slowdown. Treasury yields, already lower, fell slightly. The 2-year yield slipped to 2.45 percent. A positive in the report was the so-called real unemployment rate, which dropped to an 18-year low of 7.3 percent from 8.1 percent last month. That number includes discouraged workers as well as those holding jobs part time for economic reasons. "The modest response in Treasury yields would be consistent with a willingness to look through this data until we're seeing broad based signs of slowing to stall speed," said Jon Hill, BMO rates strategist. Economists have been expecting growth to slip under 2 percent in the first quarter due to typical weak activity in winter, the government shutdown, extreme cold weather and the trade war with China. They do expect a bounce back to a pace above 2 percent in the second quarter. Also on Friday,   were reported to have increased a surprise 18.6 percent, the fastest pace in eight months. "Anybody who is mentioning the word 'recession' is wrong. The economy invariably slows in Q1. What we don't know is it more than usual, and the poor quality and volatility in the data since the government shutdown has made it impossible to assess," said McCarthy. LaVorgna said while potentially an outlier, the weak jobs number could also be signaling that job growth has peaked. "The point is it's no longer 200,000. It's sub 200,000 gains on the back of weaker global growth and there's evidence the jobs market is not going to revert back to a sustainable 200,000 because the [unemployment] claims have been rising and the factory sector, if you looked at ISM, certainly looks like it peaked as well," said LaVorgna.

The report from the Commerce Department on Monday is welcome news for the economy after a raft of weak December data, as well as a sharp moderation in the pace of job growth in February. Still, the relatively strong retail sales report will probably not change expectations for sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter. Retail sales rose 0.2 percent. Data for December was revised down to show retail sales dropping 1.6 percent instead of tumbling 1.2 percent as previously reported. The drop in December was the biggest since September 2009 when the economy was emerging from recession. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales to be unchanged in January. Sales in January increased 2.3 percent from a year ago. The January retail sales report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. February's retail sales report, which was scheduled for publication on Thursday, will be released on April 1. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 1.1 percent in January after a downwardly revised 2.3 percent plunge in December. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have decreased 1.7 percent in December. The downward revision to December core retail sales could have an impact on the government's fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate. The government reported last month that the economy grew at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the last three months of 2018. However, December reports on the trade deficit and construction spending have led economists to believe the fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate would be revised lower when the government publishes its revision later this month. Growth estimates for the first quarter are below a 1.5 percent pace. The government reported last Friday that the economy created only 20,000 jobs in February, the fewest in nearly 1-1/2 years. Slowing job and economic growth support the Federal Reserve's "patient" approach toward further interest rate hikes this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the U.S. central bank's stance on Sunday in a wide-ranging interview with CBS's 60 Minutes news show. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the retail sales report. In January, online and mail-order retail sales increased 2.6 percent, the biggest gain since December 2017. Sales at building material stores increased 3.3 percent, the most since September 2017. But receipts at auto dealerships tumbled 2.4 percent in January, the largest drop since January 2014, after gaining 0.3 percent in the prior month. Receipts at service stations fell 2.0 percent reflecting cheaper gasoline prices. There were also declines in sales at clothing and furniture stores, as well as electronic and appliance shops. Discretionary spending rose in January, with sales at restaurants and bars advancing 0.7 percent and purchases at hobby, musical instrument and book stores jumping 4.8 percent, the largest increase since January 2013. Sales at food and beverage stores gained by the most since April 2016. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In U.S. consumer prices rose for the first time in four months in February, but the pace of the increase was modest, resulting in the smallest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years. The Labor Department said on Tuesday its Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent, lifted by gains in the costs of food, gasoline and rents. The CPI had been unchanged for three straight months. In the 12 months through February, the CPI rose 1.5 percent, the smallest gain since September 2016. The CPI increased 1.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in January. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent, the smallest increase since August 2018. The so-called core CPI had increased by 0.2 percent for five straight months. In the 12 months through February, the core CPI rose 2.1 percent. The core CPI had increased by 2.2 percent for three consecutive months on an annual basis. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI and the core CPI edging up 0.2 percent in February. The Federal Reserve, which has a 2 percent inflation target, tracks a different measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, for monetary policy. The core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in December after a similar gain in November. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March last year for the first time since April 2012. Slowing domestic and global growth are keeping inflation in check even as a tight labor market is driving up wages. Annual wage growth jumped 3.4 percent in February, the biggest increase since April 2009, from 3.1 percent in January. A New York Fed survey of consumer expectations published on Monday showed a drop in inflation expectations in February. In a wide-ranging interview with CBS's 60 Minutes news program, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Sunday reiterated the U.S. central bank's wait-and-see approach to further monetary policy tightening this year. Powell said the Fed did "not feel any hurry" to change the level of interest rates again. The Fed hiked rates four times in 2018. The January PCE price data will be released on March 19. It was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. In February, gasoline prices rose 1.5 percent after falling 5.5 percent in January. Food prices increased 0.4 percent, the biggest rise since May 2014, after gaining 0.2 percent in January. Food consumed at home rose 0.4 percent last month. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3 percent in February after a similar gain in January. Healthcare costs fell 0.2 percent after rising 0.2 percent in January. Apparel prices rose 0.3 percent last month. That followed a 1.1 percent jump in January. There were increases in the prices of motor vehicle insurance, airline fares, household furnishings and personal care products. But prices for new motor vehicles, used cars and trucks, as well as recreation fell. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Mortgage interest rates are now decidedly lower than a year ago, and home shoppers are buying in, but most are wealthier consumers purchasing more expensive homes. Total mortgage application volume rose 2.3 percent last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Volume was essentially flat compared with the same week one year ago. Falling rates were likely behind a sizable jump in loan applications to purchase a home. They rose 4 percent for the week and were 2 percent higher than a year ago. Buyers last year were up against high home prices and rising rates, pushing affordability down to the lowest level in a decade. That, combined with a severe scarcity of entry-level homes for sale, put the housing market in a deep freeze. Rates, however, began falling at the end of the year, helping affordability, but apparently only for some. "Purchase applications have now increased year over year for four weeks, which signals healthy demand entering the busy spring buying season," said Joel Kan, the MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. "However, the pickup in the average loan size continues, with the average balance reaching another record high. With more inventory in their price range compared to first-time buyers, move-up and higher-end buyers continue to have strong success finding a home." The average loan size jumped to a record $326,000, well above the nation's median home value, which the National Association of Realtors said stood at $247,500 in January. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($484,350 or less) decreased to 4.64 percent last week from 4.67 percent the week before, with points increasing to 0.47 from 0.44 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20 percent down payment. The rate was at 4.77 percent a year ago. Applications to refinance a home loan decreased 0.2 percent for the week and were 4.4 percent lower than a year ago. Rates may be lower than last year, but so many people have already refinanced at even lower rates, in the 3 percent range, that there is a limited pool of potential borrowers who could still benefit.

     Keep Me Logged In Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods edged up slightly in January, but the strength came from a big increase in the volatile aircraft category.  In encouraging news for future growth, a key category that tracks business investment plans posted its biggest gain in six months. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for durable goods rose 0.4 percent in January, led by a 15.9 percent rise in orders for commercial aircraft. The category that serves as a proxy for business investment rose 0.8 percent after two months of declines. It was the biggest gain since a 1.5 percent July bump. The weakness in business investment has puzzled economists who expected to see strength in this area as companies boosted investment spending to take advantage of new tax breaks.

     Keep Me Logged In Vodafone and Huawei have jointly built a superior 5G experience zone in Barcelona during MWC 2019. In this zone, Vodafone deployed 5G sites with commercial 5G spectrum to build a high-performance 5G network with Huawei's E2E products and solutions. Riding on this network, various eMBB services were provided using Huawei 5G commercial smartphones and CPEs to deliver the ultimate 5G service experience. The live networks were deployed in Barcelona City Center (Plaza Catalunya, Paseo de Gracia, Balmes and Universitat). Huawei's 5G E2E products and solutions were used to provide continuous live network coverage. Based on the spectrum of C-Band 80MHz, the downlink peak rate achieved was 1.7Gbps in the live 5G scenario, while the average geographical downlink throughput was about 800Mbps, enabling a genuine Gbps experience. Multiple gNodeBs (5G) were deployed at existing 4G LTE sites and provided the same coverage as that of the eNodeBs (4G LTE). This network performance proves that active antennas (massive MIMO) are the key to reduce the cost per bit for operators. With the combination of 64T64R and the 80 MHz bandwidth, compared with 4G LTE, 5G can increase the capacity of a single cell by 20-25 times and reduce the per bit traffic cost to 1/10. The coverage provided by active antennas makes 5G and 4G co-site construction possible, greatly reducing the cost of a new site. 5G eMBB is a turning point for user experience. It delivers a Gbps-level experience for smartphone users. The first 5G smartphone from Huawei was on display in the experience zone. This phone is the world's fastest foldable 5G phone. In Vodafone booth (Fira Hall 3) and Huawei booth (Hall 1 Back Garden), smartphones using 5G 80MHz spectrum were able to support super-fast video file download and play. The visual delay of the human eye is nearly 100 milliseconds (ms). The latency on a 5G network will be <20ms for consumers and can be even lower in certain enterprise applications like smart factories. With 5G, video service users can experience nearly zero wait. With the emergence and popularization of commercial terminals such as 5G smartphones and CPEs, the rapid development of 5G will provide more services for consumers and bring MBB to a new level. Santiago Tenorio, Vodafone's Group Head of Networks Strategy and Architecture, visited the experience zone and highly commended it. He remarked that it is a significant technical achievement by Vodafone and Huawei engineers to have incorporated the latest 5G standard into commercial technology so quickly. Vodafone is on track to have 5G networks ready for customers in some European cities in the second half of this year, he added. Yang Chaobin, President of Huawei's 5G Product Line, said, "Vodafone and Huawei have successfully completed the deployment of a live 5G network and provided a superior service experience based on 5G commercial terminals. Huawei will continue to work together with the industry to promote the successful commercial use of 5G."

     Keep Me Logged In U.S. wholesale prices barely increased last month after falling for three straight months, a sign there is little inflation pressure in the economy. The Labor Department says the producer price index — which measures price changes before they reach the consumer — rose 0.1 percent in February. It slipped 0.1 percent in January. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, core producer prices also rose 0.1 percent. Wholesale prices increased 1.9 percent from a year earlier, and core prices rose 2.5 percent. Despite an unemployment rate near a five-decade low and faster wage growth, inflation is tame. The Consumer Price Index, released Tuesday,   from a year ago. Mild inflation is a major reason the Federal Reserve has paused its interest rate hikes. This story is developing. Please check back for updates. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In Import prices rose 0.6 percent in February, boosted by increases in the costs of fuels and consumer goods, the Labor Department said on Thursday.  That was the biggest gain since May and followed an upwardly revised 0.1 percent rise in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.3 percent in February after a previously reported 0.5 percent drop in January. In the 12 months through February, import prices fell 1.3 percent. That followed a 1.6 percent decline in January. The report came on the heels of data showing tame producer and consumer inflation readings in February. The jump in the monthly import prices probably does not change economists' expectations that inflation will remain moderate through the first half of 2019, and allow the Fed to stay pat on interest rates. The U.S. central bank raised rates four times last year Last month, prices for imported fuels and lubricants rose 4.9 percent after increasing 4.1 percent in January. Prices for imported petroleum increased 4.7 percent after rebounding 7.1 percent in January. But food prices fell 0.8 percent in February after decreasing 0.4 percent in the prior month. Excluding fuels and food, import prices rebounded 0.2 percent last month after falling 0.3 percent in January. The so-called core import prices fell 0.3 percent in the 12 months through February. Increases in core import prices have been curbed by last year's strength in the dollar. Prices for imported consumer goods excluding automobiles rose 0.3 percent in February, reversing January's drop. The cost of goods imported from China were unchanged in February after dropping 0.3 percent in the prior month. Prices of Chinese imports dropped 0.7 percent in the 12-months through February, the biggest decline since October 2017. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In There was a time not so long ago that defeating inflation would have been considered a huge victory for the Federal Reserve. No more: The lack of price and wage pressures in the economy these days is perhaps the central bank's biggest failing. For those around in the 1970s and early '80s, runaway inflation was the single biggest threat to American prosperity. It was so bad that   deliberately pulled the country into recession in order to defeat runaway prices. Nowadays, the exact opposite is true. While Americans will still complain about the prices they pay at the grocery store and gas pump,   hasn't been around for pretty much all of the 21st century. In fact, Fed officials are concerned enough about the lack of inflation that   as part of a broader look at how they execute policy and convey their actions to the public. "It's an acute failure on the Fed's part," said Danielle DiMartino Booth, a former top aide to ex-Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher and author of "Fed Up: An Insider's Take on Why the Federal Reserve is Bad for America." "They have generated inflation, just not where it's needed." Where policymakers would like to see inflation is in areas like wages so workers can improve their standard of living, and even some discretionary consumer goods so companies can have pricing power. While  , and there is some evidence of price pressures, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge has remained stubbornly below the central bank's 2 percent goal for the most of the economic recovery that began in mid-2009. There has been, however, inflationary pressure elsewhere, particularly in prices of risky assets like stocks and corporate bonds. Indeed, a New York Fed gauge that includes prices, real activity and financial asset values — the   — sees inflation running right around 3 percent. The stock market, of course, has soared since the depths of the crisis, thanks in large part to the Fed's moves to boost risk-taking. But that's not the measure the broader Fed follows, and it remains a struggle to break out of the inflation abyss. "Had the Fed been using a 2 percent target based on the UIG, [former Chairs] Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke would have been compelled to raise interest rates much earlier than they did," said Booth, who also is CEO of Quill Intelligence. "We would not have entered this era of utter complacency where economies are less and less responsive to quantitative easing." QE, as it is called, was a bond-buying program exercised in three rounds that was aimed at lowering long-term interest rates and jacking up asset prices, which would be used as a "wealth effect" transmission mechanism to boost the economy. Along with all that was supposed to come inflation that critics of QE thought eventually would run out of control and force the Fed into a Volcker-like pattern of monetary policy tightening. The ultimate effects of the program, though, have been long debated, with St. Louis Fed economist   suggesting that QE had limited or no benefits. Current Fed Chairman   also has  , and told Washington lawmakers last week that he wants the Fed to get better at the inflation issue. Specifically, Powell said in response to a question from Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that he wants to "make that 2 percent inflation target credible, so that inflation kind of averages around 2 percent, rather than only averaging 2 percent in good times and then averaging way less than that in bad times, which would drag expectations down." "No decisions have been made," the chair added. "There are plenty of questions and concerns to be addressed. But there's also a problem that I think we owe it to the public to try to think our way through the best possible way to address that problem, so that we can carry out our mandate." Powell subscribes to a popular mindset among central bankers that inflation is most influenced by expectations — in essence, that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy if business leaders, investors and the public think inflation will be high. One possible solution, then, would be for the Fed to say it wants a higher inflation level. That, however, was dimissed by Powell during the hearing. Another way would be for the Fed to target a price level rather than a percent target, as it does now. Finally, it could simply let the economy run hotter than normal, thus driving up inflation and perhaps achieving its goal that way. "A reasonably good model of inflation expectations is adaptive expectations: the public usually expects the inflation that has recently prevailed to prevail in the future. To generate higher inflation expectations, the Fed then should focus on generating higher realized inflation," J.P. Morgan Chase economist Michael Feroli said in a recent note. "To do this it simply lets the economy run hot by keeping rates lower than it otherwise would. Over time this should stimulate aggregate demand, eventually pushing up wage and price inflation," he added. "Higher inflation leads eventually to higher inflation expectations [and] higher nominal interest rates." That has proven to be true, but there's one key ingredient for it to happen: credibility. In other words, there has to be belief that the Fed can deliver on the inflation it promises. "The Fed could come out tomorrow and say, 'We're going to target 4 percent inflation.' Great — You can't even get 2," said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. "It's a weird situation where some people might say they've got too much credibility [in keeping inflation low]. Others might say they have no credibility because they can't get the inflation they want." Moreover, LaVorgna thinks the Fed gets too much credit — or blame, as it were — for low inflation. Other factors, particularly inherently disinflationary technological advancements, and the continuing trend toward globalization, have conspired to keep inflation low, he said. On a policy level, this creates several issues for the Fed. For one thing, it's making it harder for Powell and his fellow central bankers to justify further interest rate hikes, especially with U.S. and global GDP easing back from a strong 2018. Where Fed officials said in their latest forecast that they anticipate two quarter-point hikes this year, the market is pricing in almost no chance of even one move this year. In turn, that gives the Fed less wiggle room in the case of another economic slowdown or crisis and increases the chance that the benchmark funds rate once again will head toward zero — or even to negative numbers, as one recent paper suggested. Booth, the former Dallas Fed official, said the central bank is in a quandary of its own making, caused by easy policy that generated huge amounts of debt and overcapacity, where the economy created more than it could consume. "You have to take that overcapacity out of the system. If you have zombie companies walking around, if you have a bunch of dead weight in the economy, you're never going to be able to grow," she said. "Piling more debt onto that funeral pyre isn't going to do that. It's just going to make a bigger fire." Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In February's employment report is expected to show strong job and wage growth, and could signal that the economy's slower growth in the first quarter is just a speed bump rather than a sign of trouble. The economy was expected to have added 180,000 jobs in February, and unemployment is expected to drop by a tenth to 3.9 percent. That is well below the   but economists still expect a solid report. Wage growth is expected to strengthen, rising 0.3 percent, up from January's 0.1 percent. "Jobs growth is the single best indicator of how the economy is doing. It shows both how many people are being added to payrolls. It tells you much people are being paid, and also any job that is added is a sign of strength of a company's order book and their prospects going forward," said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. He expects to see 200,000 jobs were added. The first quarter appears to be much slower than the fourth quarter, but economists are still frustrated by the lack of data, which was delayed by the government shutdown. For instance, January's retail sales will be released on Monday, much later than normal. That number is particularly important after the sharp surprising drop in December retail sales. "We expect 200,000 [jobs], a little stronger than consensus," said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. "The view is that job growth should slow because economic activity is starting to slow. We don't think 750,000 jobs over the last three months of the year is the trend. We do think things will slow down to 175,000 in the coming months. We're thinking growth slows from the 2.5 that we saw in the fourth quarter to about 2 percent at the end of the year." Many economists see growth of less than 2 percent in the first quarter but a bounce back in the second quarter as the economy shakes off the effects of the 35-day government shutdown and bad winter weather. The economy could also move beyond the drag from trade issues later in the year if there is a trade agreement between the U.S. and China and an end to tariffs. "Within the labor market, the biggest story is firms are looking to hire, and they're really just restricted by the low unemployment rate and being able to find people...With that dynamic, we still think the labor market looks strong. They're going to hire everyone they can," said Tilley. Goldman Sachs economists are less optimistic about February's job growth, and expect only 150,000 jobs, the slowest pace in five months. "We believe the trend in job growth has likely slowed from the 232k average pace of the last six months, and we also expect a drag of at least 40k from above-average snowfall during the February survey week," they wrote in a note. The Goldman economists said February seasonal factors have also become a negative, possibly because of unusually mild weather in recent years. "If so, this would also restrain payroll growth in tomorrow's report," they added. Tilley said he is watching to see if jobs were added in technology, and would expect them to be particularly in software and cloud computing. He noted that the fourth quarter GDP report showed a jump in spending in intellectual property and software by companies, with IP the strongest since the 1990s. Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in January as construction of single-family housing rebounded after four straight monthly declines, but building permits for these units fell to the lowest level since mid-2017. Housing starts jumped 18.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.230 million units in January, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Data for December was revised down to show starts declining to a rate of 1.037 million units instead of the previously reported pace of 1.078 million units. Building permits rose 1.4 percent to a rate of 1.345 million units in January, driven by an increase in permits for the volatile multi-family housing segment. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.197 million units in January. The release of the January housing starts and building permits report was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. The housing market hit a soft patch last year amid higher mortgage rates, expensive lumber as well as land and labor shortages, which led to tight inventories and less affordable homes. Investment in homebuilding contracted 0.2 percent in 2018, the weakest performance since 2010. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, surged 25.1 percent to a rate of 926,00 units in January, the highest since May 2018. The increase followed four straight monthly declines. Single-family homebuilding rose in all four regions. Permits to build single-family homes fell 2.1 percent in January to a pace of 812,000 units, the lowest level since August 2017, suggesting weakness in single-family homebuilding in the months ahead. Starts for the multi-family housing segment rose 2.4 percent to a rate of 304,000 units in January. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes increased 7.2 percent to a pace of 533,000 units. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Across the country there are more drivers on the road, and many of them hanging on to their vehicles longer than ever. That means workers like Michael Gerhart are in demand. Gerhart, a master auto technician at Pep Boys, has been fixing cars for nearly three decades, keeping on top of his skills as technology advances and learning how to do his job in a new way. Today, his focus is on engine diagnostic work, including things like the driveability of vehicles and emissions testing for the state of New Jersey. He works on different vehicles throughout the day, flexing his knowledge base on makes and models of all kinds. "Cars have changed a lot, even in the past 10 years as far as the diagnostic end of things, and training has become more advanced as far as what's required to fix the current vehicles," Gerhart said. "It definitely doesn't get boring and it's always changing." Some 46,000 automotive service technicians and mechanics will be needed to fill roles through 2026,  , at a time when the skills gap and worker shortage is particularly acute for blue-collar jobs. As economic growth is expected to continue in 2019, so too is a labor shortage both blue-collar and low-paying services occupations, a recent study from The Conference Board found. Baby boomers are aging out of the workforce at the same time the pool of available labor has become more educated, and thus less interested in blue-collar jobs. "In the U.S., more than most other advanced economies, the American dream is to go to a four-year college and not have a manual job. For a while it was a not a problem because there was no shortage. Now, there is a big shortage, and people with a bachelor's degree are just not interested in those jobs. There is a stigma connected to manual labor that is very hard to break," said Gad Levanon, chief economist at The Conference Board. The report says the shortage will be most visible in transportation, production, health-care support, food services, cleaning and maintenance occupations. To help bridge this gap of available workers, Icahn Automotive, with brands like AAMCO and Pep Boys, recently launched its "Race to 2026" program, to invest in and support future automotive technicians and students who might have an interest in the trade. The program will offer scholarships, tuition reimbursement and apprenticeship programs, along with job placement and continuing education opportunities in partnering with schools like Lincoln Tech and Universal Technical Institute. Part of the message is that this isn't the blue-collar work of years past. "I think there's a stigma around, you know, the type of work and it's still this old, kind of get-your-hands-dirty, greasy job. But as you look around, there's been dramatic change in the way that a shop looks. And today's shop is really more of a house of technology where students today should be thinking about that role as really a STEM career," said Brian Kaner, Icahn Automotive Service and Real Estate president. While the median salary for auto service technicians and mechanics was around $40,000 a year in 2017, those with experience and more advanced certifications   during their career. The Conference Board study points out that continued tightness in the labor market, while frustrating for employers, can actually be a boon for workers: They are more likely to find good-paying jobs and experience rapid wage growth. For technicians like Gerhart, it can also foster a passion. "It's been great doing this — I raised a family on this. It's a challenging field to get into, but at the end of the day, I think it's worth it. As long as you can keep up with the technology that's out there and you're given a chance to use it, it can be a very rewarding career," he said. Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

     Keep Me Logged In White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said Friday's shockingly weak jobs report is "very fluky," and he would advise not paying "any attention to it." The   was the lowest monthly increase since September 2017. Economists had expected 180,000 new jobs last month. "I think you have timing issues with respect to the government shutdown, winter seasonal issues," the director of the National Economic Council told CNBC's " ." "I think it's very fluky. I wouldn't pay any attention to it to be honest with you." Despite the jobs number, Kudlow said the U.S. economy is still on track for growth of 3 percent or more. "This is all going to be revised up," he concluded, pointing to overall gains in employment for women and blue-collar workers. Economists have been   that the government data has been inconsistent since the 35-day government shutdown and the resulting impact on the workforce. The latest government employment data came amid growing concerns about a possible global economic slowdown and whether it could be spilling over into the U.S. economy, which advanced 2.9 percent for the calendar year 2018, and 3.1 percent when measured from fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. President   commented on the report via Twitter. In the same interview Friday, Kudlow said Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping could meet regarding their trade dispute  Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In The unemployment rate   in February, according to the Labor Department. But a broader measurement says the jobless rate plunged to 7.3 percent last month. The 3.8 percent figure is known as the U-3 rate, which is defined as "total unemployed, as a percent of the civilian labor force." But this number doesn't include the underemployed or the discouraged. The U-6 rate is a more encompassing unemployment rate that counts discouraged workers who aren't currently looking for jobs as well as those holding jobs part time for economic reasons. The U-6 rate, often called the "real" unemployment rate, dropped to 7.3 percent in February from 8.1 percent in January. That is the lowest reading of the five most recent reports. The number of those employed part time for economic reasons tumbled by 837,000, to 4.3 million, while those completing temporary jobs fell by 225,000. A Labor Department office said it was a consequence of the government shutdown that ended in late February.  in February after a blistering start to the year, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by just 20,000, falling short of the relatively modest expectations of 180,000 from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. It was the worst month for job creation since September 2017, offset somewhat by a solid increase in wages. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Hiring more women and abolishing discriminatory laws would significantly boost the world economy, according to Christine Lagarde. In a recent   with The Guardian, the head of the International Monetary Fund argues that countries ranked in the bottom 50 percent for gender equality — such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon — would experience economic gains of as much as 35 percent. New   shows that the new skills and productivity levels that women introduce to the workforce yields higher economic benefits than previously thought. Hiring more women leads to "higher growth, a reduction in inequality, an improvement in the strength of the economy and a more diversified, export-focused country," Lagarde said. "Things are changing. There was a time when women in the economy, women in employment, women in finance were not seen as macro-critical. That's no longer the case," she told The Guardian. The new IMF study shows that a greater number of women on bank boards is associated with higher financial resilience and stability within the industry. However,   of bank board members — and only 2 percent of bank CEOs worldwide — are women. "What we have observed is that when there are more women the banks' capital buffers are larger, the number of non-performing loans is smaller and the risk indices are lower," Lagard said. "It is not causality but it is a strong correlation." She added that more advanced countries would also benefit from empowerment initiatives, citing the 16 percent gender pay gap among the richest countries within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an economic think tank. "In the advanced countries, I would say Austria which is changing its tax laws, and Japan, which has put its money where its mouth is and increased the budget for childcare facilities so that women can take jobs without feeling guilty," she said. A recent   study that shows 88 percent of countries have restrictions against women in the workplace embedded in their legislation. Furthermore, 59 countries have no laws prohibiting sexual harassment in the workforce and 18 countries still require women to have permission from their husband to get a job. But there has been some progress. Although the proportion of countries with discriminatory laws remains stagnant, the study showed that over the past two years, 65 countries passed a total of 87 legal reforms to increase women's economic opportunities. Lagarde said the IMF is currently pressuring countries to implement policies to empower women, such as improving road infrastructure in India to help women get to work. She added that the IMF is addressing its own "teeny tiny" pay gap. Across all countries, Lagarde said that men too have a responsibility to empower women and combat gender discrimination. "Being a feminist is not something that is reserved to women. I know many men who are feminists, who help and struggle to make sure there is no discrimination," said Lagarde.

     Keep Me Logged In Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose to a seven-month high in December, but November's outsized jump was revised lower, pointing to continued weakness in the housing market. Other data on Tuesday showed an acceleration in growth in the vast services sector in February, powered by a surge in new orders. But hiring appeared to be slowing, with a measure of services industries employment dropping to a six-month low. The moderation in the pace of hiring fits in with expectations of slower economic growth as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending ebbs. The economy's outlook is also being clouded by slowing growth in China and Europe. The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 3.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 621,000 units, the highest level since May 2018. November's sales pace was revised down to 599,000 units from the previously reported 657,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.2 percent of housing market sales, falling 8.7 percent to a pace of 600,000 units in December. New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They fell 2.4 percent from a year ago. Single-family home sales rose 1.5 percent in 2018. The release of the December report was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. The housing market hit a soft patch last year amid higher mortgage rates, expensive lumber as well as land and labor shortages, which led to tight inventories and less affordable homes. Reports last month showed homebuilding dropping to more than a two-year trough in December and home resales in January hitting their lowest level since November 2015. Though house price inflation has slowed and mortgage rates are hovering at 12-month lows, economists expect the housing market to remain weak for a while because of persistent land and labor shortages. Investment in homebuilding contracted 0.2 percent in 2018, the weakest performance since 2010. The soft housing data added to weak December construction spending, retail sales, factory orders, exports and business spending plans on equipment in setting the economy on a slower growth path in the first quarter. Despite the anticipated first-quarter weakness, the economy's fundamentals remain favorable. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index increased 3.0 points to a reading of 59.7 last month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. January's drop in the services sector index was largely blamed on financial market volatility and the government shutdown. The ISM's new orders sub-index for the services sector surged 7.5 points to a reading of 65.2 last month, the highest level since August 2005. But the survey's services industry employment measure fell 2.6 points to 55.2 in February, the weakest reading since June 2018. U.S. Treasury yields jumped after the ISM report, while U.S. stocks pared losses. The U.S. dollar was trading slightly higher against a basket of currencies. The Commerce Department report showed new home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, increased 5.0 percent to a seven-month high in December. Sales rose 1.4 percent in the West and jumped 44.8 percent in the Northeast. But they fell 15.3 percent in the Midwest to their lowest level since April 2016. The median new house price fell 7.2 percent to $318,600 in December from a year ago. There were 344,000 new homes on the market in December, the most since December 2008 and up 3.0 percent from November. Supply is, however, just over half of what it was at the peak of the housing market boom in 2006. At December's sales pace it would take 6.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.7 months in November. Just under two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.  Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In 's monster rally has notched   to a year since 1991, but by one simple measure, the market pricing seems to be ignoring the economic reality. Starting at a few points below 2,800 on Tuesday, the S&P 500 is currently trading at more than 16 times the 2019 earnings estimate for the S&P 500 firms of $172.50. But with all the bearish signs in the market — from slowing global growth to downward earnings revisions to recession fears and the Federal Reserve's tightening possibilities — the stock valuation is looking too high and is assuming the risks would be resolved in a positive way, according to Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research. "On a valuation basis this market has risen to reflect a macro environment that is materially more positive than the one we currently have, and as a fundamentals-driven analyst, that makes me nervous over the medium term," Essaye said in a note Tuesday. "The current macro setup much more matches the 'Scattered Storms' scenario, but the market valuation is reflective of a 'Partly Sunny' environment. That's a discrepancy that will have to close," Essaye pointed out, comparing market multiples to a weather forecast. The mismatch between fundamental reality and market pricing has had many on Wall Street scratching their heads as stocks' comeback coincided with a wave of downward growth and earnings revisions. The first-quarter earnings growth forecast for the S&P 500 firms has turned negative and consensus first-quarter GDP growth has also been slashed to below 2 percent. Many have said that what's driving the market is growing optimism about a trade deal with China and the Fed's   to tightening. "Either markets have to come down to where growth expectations are, or growth and earnings expectations have to move higher to justify current market valuations," Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank's chief international economist, said in a note last week. Everything will be OK seems to be the market's mantra for the past few months, but if things don't end up the way the market assumed, the S&P 500 multiple could come down to 15.5 times to 15 times, dragging the S&P 500 down by 5 to 10 percent, Essaye said.

     Keep Me Logged In Advocating the government print money without worrying about paying the bills to guarantee jobs for everyone, Medicare for all, or the Green New Deal is a dangerous approach being pushed by far-left Democrats, former   economic advisor   told CNBC on Tuesday. "I don't think this is a realistic calculus," said Summers, blasting the idea of Modern Monetary Theory, backed by self-described democratic socialists Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen.  , who last month announced another run for the White House. "This Modern Monetary Theory, where we can guarantee jobs for everybody or have Medicare for all and just rely on money printing to finance it, I think that is quite a dangerous approach," Summers said in a   interview. "Countries all over South America have tried it with disastrous results," said Summers, who also was Treasury secretary during  's presidency. He also argued that MMT-like policies were tried and reversed in the early 1980s in France and the late 1990s in Germany. Summers points out that he's been arguing for "most of the last decade" for more fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth. "But that's not the same thing as saying we can rely on money finance for everything." Economist Stephanie Kelton, an advisor to the Sanders 2016 presidential campaign,  , or MMT for short. She subscribes to a flavor of MMT that says governments like the U.S. that can borrow in their own currencies can't run out of money, because money, like bonds issued to finance federal spending, is actually a government promise not a physical commodity. Kelton told CNBC last week that the core of MMT is the idea of government-guaranteed full employment. "What we would do is effectively establish a public option in the labor market," and when companies want to hire they can dip into this pool, instead of bidding up wages for workers who already have jobs, she explained.  Chairman   was asked about MMT last week, during the delivery of his semiannual report to Congress. "The idea that deficits don't matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency, I think, is just wrong," he said. "U.S. debt is fairly high to the level of GDP — and much more importantly — it's growing faster than GDP, really significantly faster. Powell also called MMT  As for raising taxes on the wealthy, an idea also supported by Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, Summers said he would make that a last resort. "I'd sure rather tax carried interest. I'd sure rather get rid of special benefits for real estate entrepreneurs like the president. I'd sure rather collect tens of billions of dollars a year that's owed but not paid. I'd sure rather go after corporate tax shelters," Summers said. "I think we ought to look to those sources first, before we look to having whole new taxes." Sen.   — who announced last month her candidacy in the crowded field vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination — also supports a wealth tax.   Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

     Keep Me Logged In A slight rise in interest rates caused a pullback in mortgage demand last week. Total application volume fell 2.5 percent week to week, according to a seasonally adjusted index from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Volume was 2 percent lower compared with the same week one year ago. Purchase demand fell 3 percent for the week, despite more homes coming onto the market and Presidents Day weekend marking the unofficial start of the usually busy spring housing season. Volume was just 1 percent higher than the same week one year ago. Those buyers who were in the market, however, were seeking higher-priced homes. "The average loan size for purchase applications increased to a record high, led by a rise in the average size of conventional loans," said Mike Fratantoni, MBA senior vice president and chief economist. "This suggests that move-up and higher-end buyers have so far become a greater share of the spring market." Entry-level buyers have been plagued by a short supply of affordable homes for sale. The increase in listings has been mainly on the move-up and high end. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($484,350 or less) increased to 4.67 percent from 4.65 percent, with points increasing to 0.44 from 0.42 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20 percent down payment. That tiny increase was enough to pull refinance demand down 2 percent for the week and 6 percent compared with a year ago. Interest rates are almost exactly the same now as they were a year ago, so there is not a huge incentive for borrowers to refinance. Most borrowers already refinanced when rates were in the 3 percent range. Those who might want to pull cash out of their homes are more likely to take out a second loan, rather than lose that rock-bottom rate on their primary mortgage. Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In The U.S. trade deficit ballooned in December to a 10-year high of $59.8 billion, well ahead of expectations, despite President Donald Trump's efforts to reduce the number, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Reuters had been looking for an increase to $57.3 billion, from November's $50.3 billion, which was revised up $1 billion in the latest count. The expansion came due to a 2.1 percent increase in imports to $264.9 billion while exports fell 1.9 percent to $205.1 billion. Slowing global growth is causing a reduction in demand for U.S. goods, while a stronger dollar is also working against the trade balance. For the entire year, the goods and services shortfall increased by $68.8 billion, or 12.5 percent, to $621 billion as the administration railed against unfair trade practices from its global partners. It was the largest trade gap since 2008. Trump and the White House specifically have targeted China, levying a series of tariffs as it seeks a more level playing field and a stop to the theft of intellectual property. The goods deficit came to $891.3 billion for the year, the highest on record. The trade deficit with China in December was $38.7 billion, by far the most of any nation. The next highest was the European Union at $15.8 billion and Mexico at $8.8 billion. Adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit rose $10 billion to a record $91.6 billion in December and likely will weigh on the final calculations for gross domestic product. The first estimate for fourth-quarter GDP was 2.6 percent. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

     Keep Me Logged In Job creation at the company level cooled in February after a sizzling start to 2019, according to a report Wednesday from ADP and Moody's Analytics. Private companies added 183,000 workers for the month, about in line with Dow Jones estimates of 185,000. Though the number marked a deceleration, it came with some good news: ADP and Moody's sharply increased their count for January, raising the originally reported number of 213,000 all the way up to 300,000. Still, one economist thinks the decline in February could indicate that the jobs market has peaked. "The economy has throttled back, and so too has job growth," Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a statement. "Job gains are still strong, but they have likely seen their high watermark for this expansion." In a subsequent interview on CNBC, Zandi said he sees first-quarter economic growth coming in around 0.3 percent, "so it's going to start showing up in the payrolls numbers." The report comes amid robust job creation in an economy that was expected to be slowing but continues to crank out new employment opportunities. The number of unemployed — 6.3 million in December — continues to fall short of the amount of job openings, which stood at a record 7.3 million as 2018 came to a close, according to Labor Department figures. Monthly nonfarm payroll gains have averaged 240,000 over the past three months, the fastest pace since mid-2016. On the private payroll side, the ADP/Moody's report showed the biggest gains coming from professional and business services, with 49,000 new hires, while education and health services added 39,000. Construction contributed 25,000, Wall Street positions increased by 21,000 and manufacturing rose by 17,000. Broadly speaking, service industries accounted for 139,000 of the total, and goods producers were responsible for 44,000. Companies that employ 50 to 499 employees added the most, with 95,000, while large businesses hired 77,000 and small businesses increased by just 12,000. "Midsized companies have been the strongest performer for the past year," said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. "There was a sharp decline in small business growth as these firms continue to struggle with offering competitive wages and benefits." The report comes two days ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show an increase of 180,000 and a tick down in the unemployment rate to 4 percent. Economists occasionally will use the ADP/Moody's count to adjust their estimates, though the closeness of the two numbers makes that seem unlikely. Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

     Keep Me Logged In U.S. productivity grew at a rate of 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement over the third quarter. Labor costs rose 2 percent, the strongest gain since the beginning of 2018. The Labor Department reported Thursday that the result from the October-December period was slightly better than a 1.8 percent rise in the third quarter. For the full year, productivity rose 1.3 percent, a small improvement from a 1.1 percent gain in 2017. It was the best showing since a 3.4 percent productivity surge in 2010. Productivity is the amount of output per hour of work. The strong showing in 2010 had followed a 3.5 percent surge in 2009. Those two strong years were the exceptions in the current nearly 10-year long recovery. Productivity overall has been extremely weak, and economists consider boosting productivity growth as the key challenge facing the U.S. economy. Since 2007, productivity growth has averaged just 1.3 percent a year, less than half the 2.7 percent gain during the period from 2000 to 2007 and also below the average since 1947 of 2.1 percent annual gains. Economists attribute the solid gains before the deep 2007-2009 recession to the increasing use of technology in the workplace. But they have been stumped in trying to explain why productivity has slowed so much since the recession. Without a significant improvement in productivity, analysts say that the Trump administration will not be able to achieve its goal of pushing overall economic growth to sustained annual gains of 3 percent in the gross domestic product. GDP growth is determined by two major factors: growth in the labor force and growth in productivity. The 2 percent rate of increase in labor costs in the fourth quarter followed a 1.6 percent third quarter gain. Labor costs rose 1.4 percent for the year, lower than the 2.2 percent increase in 2017. The government reported last week that GDP grew at a 2.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter, a slowdown from the previous two quarters. For the year, GDP grew 2.9 percent, the best showing since 2015. However, analysts are forecasting growth to decelerate to just above 2 percent as the boost from the 2017 tax cuts and increased government spending begin to wane. In a separate report, the Labor Department said Thursday that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits  , a drop of 3,000 from the previous week. Benefit applications, a proxy for layoffs, have been at ultra-low levels for an extended period, underlining the strength of the U.S. labor market. The government on Friday will release the February unemployment report. Many economists believe it will show unemployment edged back down to 3.9 percent, from 4 percent in January.

     Keep Me Logged In Vodafone and Huawei have jointly built a superior 5G experience zone in Barcelona during MWC 2019. In this zone, Vodafone deployed 5G sites with commercial 5G spectrum to build a high-performance 5G network with Huawei's E2E products and solutions. Riding on this network, various eMBB services were provided using Huawei 5G commercial smartphones and CPEs to deliver the ultimate 5G service experience. The live networks were deployed in Barcelona City Center (Plaza Catalunya, Paseo de Gracia, Balmes and Universitat). Huawei's 5G E2E products and solutions were used to provide continuous live network coverage. Based on the spectrum of C-Band 80MHz, the downlink peak rate achieved was 1.7Gbps in the live 5G scenario, while the average geographical downlink throughput was about 800Mbps, enabling a genuine Gbps experience. Multiple gNodeBs (5G) were deployed at existing 4G LTE sites and provided the same coverage as that of the eNodeBs (4G LTE). This network performance proves that active antennas (massive MIMO) are the key to reduce the cost per bit for operators. With the combination of 64T64R and the 80 MHz bandwidth, compared with 4G LTE, 5G can increase the capacity of a single cell by 20-25 times and reduce the per bit traffic cost to 1/10. The coverage provided by active antennas makes 5G and 4G co-site construction possible, greatly reducing the cost of a new site. 5G eMBB is a turning point for user experience. It delivers a Gbps-level experience for smartphone users. The first 5G smartphone from Huawei was on display in the experience zone. This phone is the world's fastest foldable 5G phone. In Vodafone booth (Fira Hall 3) and Huawei booth (Hall 1 Back Garden), smartphones using 5G 80MHz spectrum were able to support super-fast video file download and play. The visual delay of the human eye is nearly 100 milliseconds (ms). The latency on a 5G network will be <20ms for consumers and can be even lower in certain enterprise applications like smart factories. With 5G, video service users can experience nearly zero wait. With the emergence and popularization of commercial terminals such as 5G smartphones and CPEs, the rapid development of 5G will provide more services for consumers and bring MBB to a new level. Santiago Tenorio, Vodafone's Group Head of Networks Strategy and Architecture, visited the experience zone and highly commended it. He remarked that it is a significant technical achievement by Vodafone and Huawei engineers to have incorporated the latest 5G standard into commercial technology so quickly. Vodafone is on track to have 5G networks ready for customers in some European cities in the second half of this year, he added. Yang Chaobin, President of Huawei's 5G Product Line, said, "Vodafone and Huawei have successfully completed the deployment of a live 5G network and provided a superior service experience based on 5G commercial terminals. Huawei will continue to work together with the industry to promote the successful commercial use of 5G."

     Keep Me Logged In The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to strong labor market conditions despite signs that job growth was slowing. While other data on Thursday showed an improvement in worker productivity in the fourth quarter, the trend remained sluggish. Labor costs continued to rise at a moderate pace in the last quarter, suggesting benign inflation pressures that support the Federal Reserve's "patient" stance towards further interest rate increases this year. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 223,000 for the week ended March 2, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 225,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,000 to 226,250 last week, the lowest level in a month. The claims data has no bearing on February's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. There are indications that employment growth is slowing after last year's robust gains. Part of the moderation in job growth is because of a shortage of workers. Recent Institute for Supply Management surveys showed measures of manufacturing and services sectors employment dropping in February. A report from the Fed on Wednesday showed "modest-to-moderate gains" in employment in a majority of the U.S. central bank's districts in February. The Fed's "Beige Book" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed notable worker shortages in information technology, manufacturing and construction industries as well as trucking businesses and at restaurants. The Fed said contacts reported labor shortages were restricting employment growth in some areas. The pace of job growth, however, remains more than enough to keep pushing the unemployment rate down. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180,000 jobs in February after surging by 304,000 in January. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.9 percent in February. The U.S. dollar extended gains after the release of the data on Thursday while U.S. stock index futures were little changed. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading higher. Playing Share this video...

     Keep Me Logged In Americans' net worth fell at the highest level since the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2018 as sliding stock market prices ate into the household balance sheet. Net worth dropped to $104.3 trillion as the year came to an end, a decrease of $3.73 trillion from the third quarter, according to figures released Thursday by the Federal Reserve. The fall amounted to a drop of 3.4 percent. Much of the slide came due to Wall Street's woes, as the stock market suffered a precipitous decline that started in October and briefly reached bear market status. Equities skidded as investors began to fear that the Fed would keep raising interest rates even as economic conditions began to deteriorate. By the time the market drop ended in late December, households saw $4.6 trillion worth of equity value deteriorate. The decline was offset somewhat by a $300 billion increase in real estate value. The overall move was the second-highest quarterly dollar drop since the Fed began tracking the statistic. Overall, financial assets totaled just more than $85 trillion at the end of the year, while real estate value was $29.2 trillion. Household net worth has been rising strongly since the crisis and is up 73 percent since 2009. After suffering their worst Christmas Eve in history, stocks staged a turnaround and ultimately saw their best two-month start to a year since at least 1991. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is off about 1.6 percent in March though still up more than 9 percent year to date. The fall in net worth came during a quarter when GDP rose 2.6 percent, according to a first estimate. That was part of a year that saw growth near 3 percent despite a lackluster period for financial markets. Economists largely expect 2019 to start with little growth in the economy, as the Atlanta Fed sees GDP up just 0.5 percent. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In A three percent tax on the   revenue of large internet companies could yield 500 million euros ($568.3 million) per year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. Le Maire told Le Parisien newspaper the tax is aimed at companies with worldwide digital revenue of at least 750 million and French revenue of more than 25 million euros. He said the tax would target some 30 companies, mostly  , but also  ,  ,   and  , as well as one French firm and several firms with French origins that have been bought by foreign companies. The paper listed  ,  ,   and   (the four so-called "GAFA" companies) but also Uber, Airbnb,   and French online advertising specialist   as targets. "A taxation system for the 21st century has to built on what has value today, and that is data," Le Maire said. He added it is also a matter of fiscal justice, as the digital giants pay some 14 percentage points less tax than European small-and-medium sized companies. Fairer taxes are a key demand of the "yellow vest" protests seen across France in the past three months. Le Maire said the tax would target platform companies that earn a commission on putting companies in touch with customers. Companies selling their products on their own websites would not be targeted, such as French retailer Darty which sells TVs and washing machines via its website. But companies such as Amazon earning money as a digital intermediary between a producer and a client would have to pay. The tax would also target the sales of personal data for advertising purposes. In order to avoid penalizing companies who already pay taxes in France, the amount paid will be deductible from pretax income, Le Maire said. He will present a draft law to the cabinet on Wednesday before it is presented to parliament. France has led a push for firms with significant digital revenue in the European Union to pay more tax at source, but has made little headway as Germany is cool to the idea, while member states with low corporate tax rates such as Luxembourg and Ireland firmly oppose the proposal. In an interview with weekly Journal du Dimanche,   CEO Alexandre Bompard said it is high time to end the fiscal imbalance between brick-and-mortar firms like his and the U.S. and Chinese internet platform companies. "They pour their products onto markets without even paying value-added tax, and hardly any other tax at all, it is intolerable. On the same turnover they should pay the same tax," he said.

     Keep Me Logged In Republican  , former governor of   and   rival for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, told CNBC on Monday he wants to help his "friend" the president, but he's content to do it from afar. "I'm not one of these people who's desperate for a job. I think I turned down seven of them down," Christie said in a   interview. "I'm not desperate for a title. I'm not looking to run to Washington, D.C. What I'm looking to do is to make the country better and to help my friend." Among the jobs that Christie said he declined in the Trump administration included Labor secretary, Homeland Security secretary, special assistant to the president, ambassador to Rome and ambassador to the Vatican. "He hasn't offered me anything that I really wanted to do," said Christie, author of "Let Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey, and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics." "If there's something I really want to do and I think I bring real value to him and the country I'll step up and do it," he added. "I can certainly help him from where I am. And it's much better for my family if I stay where I am." In his book, Christie describes the discussions around his support of Trump after dropping out of the 2016 race. The former governor writes that he said,at the time that his endorsement was not conditional, but he was only interested in the vice president or attorney general jobs, which respectively went to then-Indiana Gov.   and then-Sen.  . After a tumultuous relationship with Trump over the investigation into Russia's alleged influence in the 2016 election by special counsel  , Trump forced out Sessions last November. William Barr was sworn in as Sessions' replacement last month. The 68-year-old Barr served as George H.W. Bush's attorney general. Christie told CNBC he advised the president after the firing of   as FBI director in May 2017, a move that eventually led to Mueller's appointment. Christie, himself a former U.S. attorney, suggested a potential replacement for Comey – and the name turned out to be Trump's eventual choice. "When he fired Jim Comey, we talked extensively about who should replace him. And I brought the name Chris Wray to him," Christie said. "And he became convinced that Chris was the right guy, and has been supportive of Chris as he's moved to really change the FBI." Wray, who was Christie's attorney in the Bridgegate scandal and served as assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division under George W. Bush, was sworn in as FBI director in August 2017. Since his book came out, Christie told CNBC, he has spoken to Trump. The president said, "'You're nice to me,'" recalled Christie, who described how best to communicate with Trump. "Sometimes that means telling him something he doesn't want to hear. Sometimes he takes it very well and listens, and takes it all in. Sometimes he tells me, 'Didn't I beat you? Why do I have to listen to you?' It depends on the day." "That's the ABCs of him, and that's what you've got to get used to if you've been his friend for 17 years. Nothing new," concluded Christie.

     Keep Me Logged In U.S. construction spending unexpectedly fell in December as investment in both private and public projects dropped, further evidence the economy lost momentum at the tail end of 2018. The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending declined 0.6 percent after an unrevised 0.8 percent increase in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.2 percent in December. The report extended the run of weak economic December data, that has included retail sales, housing starts, trade and home sales. Construction spending increased 1.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in December. It rose 4.1 percent in 2018, the weakest reading since 2011. The release of the December report was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the government that ended on Jan. 25. December's weak construction spending data could have an impact on the government's fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate published last Friday. The government reported the economy grew at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the October-December period, slowing from the third quarter's brisk 3.4 percent pace. In December, spending on private construction projects fell 0.6 percent after surging 1.3 percent in November. Investment in private residential projects tumbled 1.4 percent after rebounding 3.4 percent in November. The housing market has been weighed down by higher mortgage rates, expensive building materials as well as land and labor shortages. Residential investment contracted 0.2 percent in 2018. Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, gained 0.4 percent in December after declining 1.1 percent in November. Spending on nonresidential structures contracted in both the third and fourth quarters. Investment in public construction projects fell 0.6 percent in December to an eight-month low after decreasing 1.0 percent in November. Spending on federal government construction projects plunged 2.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in November. Investment in state and local government construction projects fell 0.5 percent in December to an eight-month low after dropping 1.1 percent in the prior month. Got a confidential news tip?

     Keep Me Logged In  President   looked set to open a new front in his trade wars on Monday with a plan to end preferential trade treatment for   that allows duty-free entry for up to $5.6 billion worth of its exports to the United States. India played down the impact, saying it was keeping retaliatory tariffs out of its talks with the United States, but the opposition could seize on the issue to embarrass Prime Minister   ahead of general elections this year. Trump, who has vowed to cut U.S. trade deficits, has repeatedly called out India for its high tariffs, and U.S. trade officials said scrapping the concessions would take at least 60 days after notifications to Congress and the Indian government. "I am taking this step because, after intensive engagement between the United States and the government of India, I have determined that India has not assured the United States that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets of India," Trump told congressional leaders in a letter. India is the world's largest beneficiary of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which dates from the 1970s, and ending its participation would be the strongest punitive action against it since Trump took office. Reuters last month reported the planned U.S. action, which comes as the United States and   appear close to a deal to roll back U.S. tariffs on at least $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. The U.S. Trade Representative's Office said India's removal from the GSP would not take effect for at least 60 days after the notifications. "Discussions are on with the United States, and given cordial and strong ties, (we are) keeping retaliatory tariffs out of it," Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said in New Delhi. The preferential treatment brought India an annual "actual benefit" of just $190 million, he told reporters. Of the 3,700 products covered, India used the concession for just 1,784, Wadhawan added. "The benefit to industry is low, U.S. tariffs are already low," said another government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "GSP is more symbolic of the strategic relationship, not in value terms." Farm, marine and handicraft products are among India's exports most likely to be hit, Ajay Sahai, the director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, told Reuters, but Indian shares were little changed on the news. Last week, India delayed until April 1 higher tariffs on some U.S. imports announced in response to a U.S. refusal to exempt it from new steel and aluminium tariffs. Despite its limited impact, the GSP removal could hurt Modi's Hindu nationalist ruling party ahead of the election, expected in the next couple of months. "It can become a political issue in an election year," said the official who declined to be named. Modi's own relationship with Trump has been limited, with their meetings less frequent than those of Chinese President   with Trump, for example. Trade ties with the United States suffered after India adopted new rules on e-commerce curbing how internet retail giants   and  -backed Flipkart do business. That followed a drive by New Delhi to force global card payments companies such as Mastercard Inc and Visa Inc to move their data to India and higher tariffs on electronic products and smartphones. In 2017, the United States protested against India's decision to cap prices of medical devices. "India has implemented a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on United States commerce," said the USTR, which estimates the United States ran a goods and services trade deficit of $27.3 billion with India in 2017. "Despite intensive engagement, India has failed to take the necessary steps to meet the GSP criterion," it added. India's top GSP exports to the United States in 2017 included motor vehicle parts, ferro alloys, precious metal jewellery, building stone, insulated cables and wires, said business grouping the Confederation of Indian Industry. "Some industries which are highly export-oriented to the American markets would be impacted, like pharma or textiles," said Siddharth Sedani, equity advisory head at brokerage Anand Rathi. India's falling trade deficit with the United States is estimated to have narrowed by more than $4 billion in 2018, the trade ministry said, adding it would fall further on growing demand for energy and civilian aircraft.

     Keep Me Logged In Home prices in January rose at the slowest pace in nearly seven years, but buyers shouldn't feel too confident just yet. Prices might be on the verge of picking up yet again. Home values in January were 4.4 percent higher than a year earlier, smaller than the 4.7 percent annual gain in December, according to CoreLogic. Price gains have been shrinking since April, when they peaked at a 6.6 percent gain. January's read was the smallest gain since August 2012. "The spike in mortgage interest rates last fall chilled buyer activity and led to a slowdown in home sales and price growth," said Frank Nothaft, chief economist for CoreLogic. "Fixed-rate mortgage rates have dropped 0.6 percentage points since November 2018 and today are lower than they were a year ago. With interest rates at this level, we expect a solid homebuying season this spring." The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage rose above 5 percent at the start of November but then began sliding. It now sits around 4.5 percent, right around where it was a year ago, when price gains were in the 6 percent range annually. So that could mean the end of the current price chill, as more buyers this spring compete for a still-slim supply of listings for sale. Inventories have started to rise nationwide, but mostly on the higher end of the market, which is not where the bulk of current demand is. The supply of entry-level homes for sale is still very, very low, as builders continue to focus on more expensive homes, given today's high costs for land and labor. Last spring, bidding wars were the rule, not the exception, but homes began sitting longer over the summer. In California, where home prices surged highest, sales stalled in the fall to the slowest pace in over a decade. Higher interest rates were the tipping point for buyers. Interest rates are not as low as they were following the recession, but they have pulled back enough to entice buyers again. "As we head into 2019, we can expect continued strong employment growth and rising incomes which could support a reacceleration in home-price appreciation later this year," said Frank Martell, president and CEO of CoreLogic.

     Keep Me Logged In If you're considering a new job, "there's no time like the present," said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at job-hunting website Glassdoor. Median annual base pay for full-time workers rose to  , according to the latest   from Glassdoor. However, the  , market losses, geopolitical uncertainly and weakening effects from the 2017 tax cuts are contributing to headwinds, which are starting to slow down wage growth, Zhao said. February's base pay was up only 1.3 percent from last year and wage growth in January was revised down to 2 percent from 2.3 percent, Glassdoor found. Indeed,   has been sluggish throughout the economic expansion, struggling to break 3 percent despite the tight labor market. Yet the most recent deceleration is "a little bit concerning," Zhao said. "Weakening pay growth is a warning sign for the labor market as we dig into 2019, but time will tell if this downward trend will continue." High-end job positions, such as data scientists, are seeing some of the greatest wage declines, Glassdoor found, mostly due to more people entering the field. On the flip side, low-wage positions, such as cashiers and bank tellers, are notching some of the largest wage gains, according to Glassdoor, largely because of increases in the  . Overall, "this is still a good time for workers to look for a new job," Zhao said. "If they can find a job that fits them and pays well, they should go for it." Across all skills levels, about one-third of workers are looking to change jobs in 2019, down from 40 percent last year, according to CareerBuilder's annual study on the state of the labor market. There has already been some evidence of a spike in  : The number of Americans filing applications for jobless benefits increased more than expected last week and the number of people on unemployment rolls rose to a 10-month high. Last year, there were more openings than there were people looking for jobs.   in January but is still not far from its lowest point in five decades, according to the Labor Department. Altogether, 40 percent of employers said they plan to hire full-time, permanent employees in 2019, down slightly from 44 percent last year, CareerBuilder found. Still, half of all human resource managers also said they can't find qualified candidates to fill their open positions, which is about the same as last year. To make the most of today's market, CareerBuilder identified the top three jobs in each state by wage category and the skills required to land those positions. (See the chart below.) Although job seekers say factors such as location, affordable benefits, job stability, a good boss and work culture are more important than salary when considering a position, changing jobs is still a good way to give your  , particularly in the face of stagnant wages. People who switched jobs saw their wages rise nearly 4 percent, versus 3 percent for workers who stayed in the same job, according to an analysis of  . "Be savvy in considering all of the factors that weigh in to employment decisions," said Michelle Armer, chief people officer at CareerBuilder. "That will increase your overall lifestyle satisfaction." CareerBuilder polled more than 1,000 hiring managers and more than 1,000 full-time U.S. workers across industries from December to January.

     Keep Me Logged In The Federal Reserve may need "several meetings" to get a good read on the U.S. economy, a top monetary policymaker said on Tuesday, a clear signal that the Fed's rate-hike holiday may last for a while. Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said earlier concerns that the economy might overheat without higher interest rates now seem "less pressing," with little inflation pressure and sharp market swings at the end of 2018 making investors less ebullient. At the same time, slower growth in Europe and China and ongoing trade conflict make it hard to have confidence about the U.S. economy staying strong, he said. The remarks in a speech on Tuesday represent a stark change in emphasis for Rosengren, who is a voting member on the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. As recently as January, he said two rate hikes could still be necessary in 2019 if optimistic economic forecasts came true. Fed officials signaled in January that rate hikes were on hold, saying they would be "patient" before making any moves, after raising rates four times in 2018. "It may be several meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee before Fed policymakers have a clearer read on whether the risks are becoming reality—and by how much the economy will slow compared to last year," Rosengren said in remarks prepared for a chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors in Boston. "Patiently watching to see how the economy develops is the appropriate policy for now, and represents prudent management of risks to the forecast." The Fed's next policy meeting will be held March 19-20, followed by gatherings in April, June and July. Asked if a rate hike would be warranted if the economy develops as he expects, Rosengren was noncommital but said there could be circumstances that would require tightening to be "on the table." He added that the Fed's "patient" stance means not giving "a lot of guidance" as to what the Fed is expecting. Rosengren, who last year said tight labor markets could spark inflation, on Tuesday said that strong hiring trends are not showing "much risk" of pushing prices higher, possibly because companies have enough profits to eat higher costs. He forecasts U.S. economic growth "somewhat" above 2 percent in 2019, with inflation close to the Fed's 2 percent target. Yet bonds and foreign stock prices reflect elevated risk, sending an unclear message about what lies ahead. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip?
